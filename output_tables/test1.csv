Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will 
use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index."
"In cases of a spin-off resulting in multiple new securities,  what determines which of these securities may be reconsidered for the next Index Review?","Answer: In cases of a spin-off resulting in multiple new securities, the determination of which securities may be reconsidered for the next Index Review is based on the reevaluation of all securities created as a result of the spin-off of an existing Index constituent. These securities will not be added to the Indexes at the time of the event implementation but will be reevaluated for addition in the Indexes at the subsequent Index Review.

","3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance   The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Indexes between Index Reviews. 
For cases where additions are noted  below, securities will be added to the Index only if added to the 
Parent Index. Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of  a change in business involvement, MSCI ESG Rating and/or failure to comply 
with the UN Global Compact Principles and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies Score . 
 
  
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
New additions to the Parent Index  A new security added to the Parent Index (such as IPO 
and other early inclusions), will not be added to the 
Index.   
Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes  at the time of event implementation. 
Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review.  
Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Inde x and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index.  
Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.) Reevaluation for cont inued 
inclusion in the Index will occur at the subsequent 
Index Review.  
Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events relevant to this Index 
can be found in the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology book."
"What specific circumstances would lead MSCI to assess a security's environmental, social,  and governance scores after an Index Review rather than during it?","Answer: MSCI assesses a security's environmental, social, and governance scores after an Index Review rather than during it when the ESG data for some securities is not published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the Index Review. In such cases, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of the month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Index.

","2.3 Weighting  Scheme The remaining securities, after the exclusions based on section 2.2, are weighted in proportion of their 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Additionally, security weights are adjusted to specific requirements of neutrality and active exposure 
relative to sector/country/region categories as detailed in Appendix III.  The applicable region 
neutrality and active exposure co nstraints, along with the GHG -Intensity reduction described in the 
next section (2.4) , are applied through an iterative process until all restrictions are met simultaneously. 2.4 GHG Intensity Reduction   After the weighting scheme is applied as per section 2. 3, the GHG intensity relative to the Parent Index 
is assessed. If the GHG intensity3 is not at least 30% lower than the Parent Index , additional securities 
are excluded from the Eligible Universe to achieve a reduction of 30% GHG intensity relative to the 
Parent Index. The following iterative process is applied : 
1. Securities are ranked in descending order of GHG intensity. 2. The security with the highest GHG intensity is excluded and the resulting Index is compared 
to the Parent Index, to deter mine if a 30% reduction in GHG intensity has been achieved.  
3 Please refer to Appendix I V for details of the calculation of GHG Intensity. 3. If the reduction has been achieved, no further securities are excluded. If the reduction has not 
been achieved, further securities are excluded as per steps 1 and 2 until the 30% reduction is 
achieved .

"How is revenue from fossil fuel extraction categorized differently in terms of ""restrictiveness levels"" in comparison to other exclusions,  such as conventional weapons?","Answer: Revenue from fossil fuel extraction is not categorized under the ""restrictiveness levels"" framework used by MSCI ESG Research for other exclusions. While controversial activities like conventional weapons are assigned to specific restrictiveness levels (such as ""Most Restrictive"" for controversial weapons), fossil fuel extraction is explicitly excluded from this categorization. This indicates that fossil fuel extraction is treated differently and does not fall under the same restrictiveness level framework as other exclusions like conventional weapons.

","MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four level s of restrictiveness : Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive  and Least Restrictive . 
Each controversial activity screened by the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes ( except Fossil Fuel Extraction, 
Thermal Coal Power, Palm Oil, Arctic Oil & Gas and Global Norms ) is assigned to one of these 
restrictiveness  levels : 
 
""Most Restrictive"" screen applied * Controversial Weapons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fossil Fuel Extraction"
