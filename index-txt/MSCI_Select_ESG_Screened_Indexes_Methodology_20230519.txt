MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  
 
 
1 Introduct ion 
The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (“the Indexes”) are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (“Parent Indexes”) based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:   
• Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or  
• Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of ´CCC´ or  
• Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
• Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
• Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles  
In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (“Parent Indexes”)1. 
  
 
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents (“Methodology Set”), including the present i ndex 
methodology document. The Methodology Set for the Indexes can be accessed from MSCI’s webpage https://www.msci.com/index -
methodology in the section ‘Search Methodology by Index Name or Index Code’.  
The Methodology Set includes a document ‘ESG Factors in Methodology’ that contains the list of environmental, social, and 
governance factors considered, and how they are applied in the methodology (e.g., selection, weighting or exclusion).

2 Constructing the MSCI Select ESG Screened Index es  
Constructing the Indexes involves the following steps  
• Defining the Eligible Universe  
• Applying the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Intensity Reduction  
2.1 Eligible Universe  
The Eligible Universe for the Indexes  include s all the constituents of their respective Parent Index, as 
shown in Appendix II.  
2.2 Eligibility Criteria  
The Indexes use company ratings and research provided by MSCI ESG Research2 to determine 
eligibility for Index inclusion . 
ESG Ratings Eligibility   
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage 
their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies with an MSCI ESG Rating of ´CCC´ are excluded from 
the Indexes.  
ESG Exclusions  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business In volvement Screening Research to identify companies that are 
involved in the following business activities. Companies that meet the business involvement criteria 
are excluded from the Indexes . 
• Conventional Weapons  
• Controversial Weapons  
• Nuclear Weapons  
• Civilian Firearms  
• Tobacco  
• Fossil Fuel Extraction  
• Thermal Coal Power  
• Arctic Oil & Gas  
• Palm Oil  
 
 
2 See section 4 for further information regarding ESG and climate dat a used in the Indexes that MSCI Limited sources from MSCI ESG 
Research LLC, a separate subsidiary of MSCI Inc. MSCI ESG Research is solely responsible for the creation, determination and 
management of such data. MSCI Limited is the benchmark administrator for the MSCI indexes.

MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  
 
 
In addition to the above, companies are also excluded from the Indexes if they exhibit any of the 
following characteristics:  
 
• Companies assessed as having involv ement in ESG controversies that are classified as Red Flags 
(MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0). A Red Flag indicates an ongoing Very Severe ESG controversy 
implicating a company directly through its actions, products, or operations . 
• Companies assessed as ha ving involvement in Land Use and Biodiversity controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment – Land Use and Biodiversity 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to 
the company’s actions, products, or operations . 
• Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment – Supply Chain Management 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to 
the company’s actions, products, or operations . 
• Missing MSCI ESG Controversies Score – Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on 
MSCI ESG Controversies . 
• Failure to comply with the United Nations Global Compact Principl es (UN Global Compact 
Alignment value of “Fail”).  
• Please refer to Appendix I for details on these criteria.  
2.3 Weighting  Scheme  
The remaining securities, after the exclusions based on section 2.2, are weighted in proportion of their 
free float -adjusted market capitalization.  
Additionally, security weights are adjusted to specific requirements of neutrality and active exposure 
relative to sector/country/region categories as detailed in Appendix III.  The applicable region 
neutrality and active exposure co nstraints, along with the GHG -Intensity reduction described in the 
next section (2.4) , are applied through an iterative process until all restrictions are met simultaneously.  
2.4 GHG Intensity Reduction    
After the weighting scheme is applied as per section 2. 3, the GHG intensity relative to the Parent Index 
is assessed. If the GHG intensity3 is not at least 30% lower than the Parent Index , additional securities 
are excluded from the Eligible Universe to achieve a reduction of 30% GHG intensity relative to the 
Parent Index. The following iterative process is applied : 
1. Securities are ranked in descending order of GHG intensity.  
2. The security with the highest GHG intensity is excluded and the resulting Index is compared 
to the Parent Index, to deter mine if a 30% reduction in GHG intensity has been achieved.  
 
3 Please refer to Appendix I V for details of the calculation of GHG Intensity.

3. If the reduction has been achieved, no further securities are excluded. If the reduction has not 
been achieved, further securities are excluded as per steps 1 and 2 until the 30% reduction is 
achieved .

3 Maintaining the MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes  
3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  
The Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November.  
In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x.  
The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date.  
3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies  
Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 (‘Red flag’ 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles.  
MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will 
use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index.  
The pro forma Indexes are generally announced nine business days before the first business day of 
the month.  
3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance    
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the Indexes.  
No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Indexes between Index Reviews. 
For cases where additions are noted  below, securities will be added to the Index only if added to the 
Parent Index.  
Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously.  
There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of  a change in business involvement, MSCI ESG Rating and/or failure to comply 
with the UN Global Compact Principles and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies Score .

EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  A new security added to the Parent Index (such as IPO 
and other early inclusions), will not be added to the 
Index.   
 
Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes  at the time of event implementation. 
Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review.  
 
Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Inde x and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index.  
 
Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.) Reevaluation for cont inued 
inclusion in the Index will occur at the subsequent 
Index Review.  
 
Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events relevant to this Index 
can be found in the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology book.

4 MSCI ESG Research  
The Indexes are products of MSCI Inc. that utilize information such as company ratings and researc h 
produced and provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC (MSCI ESG Research), a subsidiary of MSCI Inc. In 
particular, the  Indexes use the following MSCI ESG Research products:  MSCI ESG Controversies , MSCI  
ESG Business Involvement Screening Research and MSCI Clim ate Change Metrics . MSCI Indexes are 
administered by MSCI Limited.  
4.1 MSCI ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings aim to measure entities’ management of environmental, social and governance 
risks and opportunities. MSCI ESG Ratings use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score ( 0-10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from ‘AAA’ to ‘CCC’, indicating how an entity manages relevant key issues relative 
to industry peers.  
The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/esg -and-climate -
methodologies . 
4.2 MSCI ESG Controversies  
MSCI ESG Controversies provide assessments of controversies concerning the potential negative 
environmental, social, and/or governance impact of company operations, products and services. The 
evaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is designed to be consistent with international 
norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies Score falls on a 
0-10 scale, with “0” being the  most severe controversy.  
The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/esg -and-climate -
methodologies . 
4.3 MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research  
MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research (BISR) aims to enable institutional investors to 
manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and restrictions reliably and 
efficiently.  
For more details on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research, please refer to 
http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/MSCI_ESG_BISR.pdf . 
4.4 MSCI Climate Change Metrics  
MSCI Climate Change Metrics provides climate data & tools to suppor t institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and reporting on climate risk 
exposure, implemen ting low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks.

Information containing any historica l information, data or analysis should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of any future performance, analysis, foreca st 
or prediction.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.   
The Information should not be relied on and is not a subst itute for the skill, judgment and experience of the user, its management, employees, advisors and/or clients

None of the Information constitutes an offer to sell (or a solicitation of an offer to buy), any security, financial product or other investment vehicle or any trading

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is only available through third 
party investable instruments (if any) based on that index.   MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express any opi nion regarding 
any fund, ETF, derivative or other security, investment, financial product or trading strategy that is based on, linked to or  seeks to provide an investment return related 
to the performance of any MSCI index (collectively, “Index Linked Inv estments”). MSCI makes no assurance that any Index Linked Investments will accurately track 
index performance or provide positive investment returns.  MSCI Inc. is not an investment adviser or fiduciary and MSCI makes  no representation regarding the 
advisa bility of investing in any Index Linked Investments.  
Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates i ndexes, but does not manage actual 
assets. The calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees 
an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments. The imposition of these fees  and charg es would cause the 
performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI index performance.  
The Information may contain back tested data.  Back -tested performance is not actual performance, but is hypothetical.  There are frequently mater ial differences 
between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.   
Constituents of MSCI equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the  application of the relevant index 
methodologies. Accordingly, constituents in MSCI equity indexes may include MSCI Inc., clients of MSCI or suppliers to MSCI.  Inclusion of a security within an MSCI 
index is not a recommendation by MSCI to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.  
Data and information produced by various affiliates of MSCI Inc., including MSCI ESG Research LLC and Barra LLC, may be used in calculating certain MSCI indexes.  
More information can be found in  the relevant index methodologies on www.msci.com.  
MSCI receives compensation in connection with licensing its indexes to third parties.  MSCI Inc.’s revenue includes fees base d on assets in Index Linked Investments.
