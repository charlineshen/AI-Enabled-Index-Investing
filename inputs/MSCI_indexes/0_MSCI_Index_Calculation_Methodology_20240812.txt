 Introduction  
 
This methodology book describes MSCI's general Index calculation methodology for 
the MSCI Equity Indexes.  
MSCI provides two ways of calculating MSCI Equity Indexes, either by using the Price 
Adjustment Factor (PAF) or the Index Divisors (Index Divisors methodology available 
as an appendix).  
These policies and guidelines affect all securities across the MSCI Equity Indexes 
and products. Unless otherwise stated the policies and guidelines apply therefore to 
all securities in the MSCI Equity universe.  
Please note that the index construction methodology and other guiding principles for 
MSCI Indexes can be found at www.msci.com . 
MSCI Equity Indexes  
The MSCI Equity Indexes measure the performance of a set of equity securities over 
time. The MSCI Equity Indexes are calculated using the Laspeyres' concept of a 
weighted arithmetic average together with the concept of chain -linking.  
MSCI country and regional equity Indexes are calculated in "local currency" as well as 
in USD, with price, gross and net returns.  
Index levels are also available in several other currencies such as AUD, BRL, CAD, 
CHF, CNY, EUR, GBP, HKD, INR, JPY, KRW, RUB , SGD , CZK, DKK, IDR, MXN, MYR, NOK, 
NZD, SEK, and TWD . 
While the local currency series of regional indexes cannot be replicated in the real 
world, it represents the theoretical performance of an index without any impact from 
foreign exchange fluctuations -- a continuously hedged portfolio.  
Indexes are calculated 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday with the exception of a 
selection of indexes that have Sunday calculations available.  
In certain cases, where there are no qualifying securities, it is possible for MSCI 
Indexes to be empty following a security deletion or GICS change. If an index 
becomes empty it would be dynamically discontinued or 'ruptured'. It is then possible 
for the index to be re -started once a new security qualifies for the index, and this 
index level would be rebased to an appropriate level at that time.  
 For index maintenance purposes, MSCI often uses data received from many different 
sources.   Such data may need to be taken on specific and defined dates as relevant 
to a specific index methodology ('Data Date') . In certain instances, due to an 
extraordinary event or exceptional technical issue, data needed as of a Data Date 
may not be available as expected from MSCI's data sources. In such cases, unless 
specified otherwise in the relevant index methodology, MSCI g enerally uses the latest 
data available prio r to the Data Date.  MSCI will release a n announcement to inform 
clients about the occurrence of these events . 
MSCI independently monitors the quality of data from its data sources on an ongoing 
basis.  MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use data from alternative 
sources if MSCI determines that the primary source data is not reflective of market 
conditions.  In such circumstances, and if deemed material, MSCI will release a n 
announcement to inform clients about the change.  All such determinations are made 
by the MSCI Equity Index Committee (EIC).  If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a 
consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the most relevant 
alternate source . 
 1 MSCI Price Index Methodology  
Price indexes measure the market prices performance for a selection of securities. 
They are calculated daily and, for some of them, on a real time basis. Each index 
captures the market capitalization weighted return of all constituents included in the 
inde x. 
1.1 PRICE INDEX LEVEL  
As a general principle, today's index level is obtained by applying the change in the 
market performance to the previous period index level.  
 
PriceIndexLevelUS Dt=PriceIndexLevelUS Dt-1*IndexAdjustedMarketCapUS Dt
IndexInitialMarketCapUS Dt 
 
PriceIndexLevelLoca lt=PriceIndexLevelLoca lt-1*IndexAdjustedMarketCapForLoca lt
IndexInitialMarketCapUS Dt 
 
Where:  
* PriceIndexLevelUSDt-1 is the Price Index level in USD at time t -1 
* IndexAdjustedMarketCapUSDt is the Adjusted Market Capitalization of the index in 
USD at time t  
* IndexInitialMarketCapUSDt is the Initial Market Capitalization of the index in USD at 
time t  
* PriceIndexLevelLocalt-1 is the Price Index level in local currency at time t -1 
* IndexAdjustedMarketCapForLocalt is the Adjusted Market Capitalization of the 
index in USD converted using FX rate as of t -1 and used for local currency index at time t  
 
Note: IndexInitialMarketCapUSD  was previously called 
IndexUnadjustedMarketCapPreviousUSD

Where:  
* EndOfDayNumberOfS harest-1 is the number of shares of security s at the end of 
day t -1. 
* PricePerS haret is the price per share of the security s at time t.  
* PricePerS haret-1 is the price per share of security s at time t -1. 
* InclusionFactort is the inclusion factor of the security s at time t. The inclusion factor 
can be one or the combination of the following factors: Foreign Inclusion Factor, 
Domestic Inclusion Factor, Growth Inclusion Factor, Value Inclusion Factor, Index 
Inclusion Factor (*). 
* PAFt is the Price Adjustment Factor of the security s at time t.  
* FXratet is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs USD at time t. It is the value 
of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
* FXratet-1 is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs USD at time t -1. It is the 
value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
* ICIt is the Internal Currency Index of price currency at time t. The ICI is different than 1 
when a country changes the internal value of its currency (e.g. from Turkish Lira to New 
Turkish Lira - ICI = 1,000,000).  
* ICIt-1 is the Internal Currency Index of price currency at time t -1. 
  
(*) From June 1 2007 to May 31 2008, to calculate the standard or small cap index 
market capitalization (except for FM countries and China A), the security market cap 
should be multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor. 
Additionally, s tarting December 1, 2015, to calculate the standard or small cap index 
market capitalization (except for China A), the security market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor.  
From September 1 2009 to November 30 2009, to calculate the China A and related 
indexes markets capitalization, the China A securities market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard Index Inclusion Factor.  
The 'Standard Index Inclusion Factor' is solely used for the computation of the MSCI 
Standard Indexes, and not for the Large Cap, Mid Cap and Provisional Indexes, as 
these are all constructed using the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology 
and were not subject to the transition methodology.  
The 'Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor' is not used for the computation of the MSCI 
Emerging Markets and AC Small Cap Indexes, MSCI Small Cap Value and Growth, 
MSCI Provisional Small Cap and MSCI Small Cap Sectors Indexes, as these are all 
constructed using  the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology and were not 
subject to the transition methodology.  
 
Note:  
The only difference in the formulas between USD and local currency indexes 
calculation is that the same exchange rate is used in the numerator and denominator 
for local currency, which means that there is no impact of currency change in the 
performance. Ti me variant exchange rates are used for the USD calculation.

 1.2 PRICE INDEX LEVEL (ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION FORMULA - 
CONTRIBUTION METHOD)  
Another way to calculate the index level would be to use the initial weight and price 
return of the individual securities included in the index:  
PriceIndexLevelUSD t=PriceIndexLevelUSD t-1*(1+SecurityPriceContributionToIndexUSD t)
sI,t 
PriceIndexLevelLocal t=PriceIndexLevelLocal t-1*(1+SecurityPriceContributionToIndexLocal t)

index market capitalization (except for China A), the security market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor.  
From September 1 2009 to November 30 2009, to calculate the China A and related 
indexes markets capitalization, the China A securities market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard Index Inclusion Factor.  
The 'Standard Index Inclusion Factor' is solely used for the computation of the 
MSCI Standard Indexes, and not for the Large Cap, Mid Cap and Provisional 
 Indexes, as these are all constructed using the Global Investable Market Indexes 
methodology and were not subject to the transition methodology.  
The 'Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor' is not used for the computation of the MSCI 
Emerging Markets and AC Small Cap Indexes, MSCI Small Cap Value and Growth, 
MSCI Provisional Small Cap and MSCI Small Cap Sectors Indexes, as these are all 
constructed using  the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology and were not 
subject to the transition methodology.  
The list of index constituents as of time t+1 is considered in the calculation.

1.4 CLOSING INDEX MARKET CAPITALIZATION TODAY USD (UNADJUSTED 
MARKET CAP TODAY USD)  
The value of the index market capitalization as of the close of a day is calculated 
as follows:  
 
IndexClosingMarketCapUSD t=ClosingNumberOfS hares t*PricePerS hare t*InclusionFactor t
FXrate t
sI,t 
 
Where  
* ClosingNumberOfS harest is the number of shares of security s at the close of t.  
* PricePerS hare tis the security price per share of security s at time t.  
* InclusionFactort is the inclusion factor of the security s at time t. The inclusion 
factor can be one or the combination of the following factors: Foreign Inclusion 
Factor, Domestic Inclusion Factor, Growth Inclusion Factor, Value Inclusion Factor, 
Index Inclusion Factor (*). 
 * FXratet is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs USD at time t. It is the 
value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
 
(*) From June 1 2007 to May 31 2008, to calculate the standard or small cap index 
market capitalization (except for FM countries and China A), the security market 
cap should be multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor. 
Additionally, s tarting December 1, 2015, to calculate the standard or small cap 
index market capitalization (except for China A), the security market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard or Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor.  
From September 1 2009 to November 30 2009, to calculate the China A and related 
indexes markets capitalization, the China A securities market cap should be 
multiplied by the Standard Index Inclusion Factor.  
The 'Standard Index Inclusion Factor' is solely used for the computation of the 
MSCI Standard Indexes, and not for the Large Cap, Mid Cap and Provisional 
Indexes, as these are all constructed using the Global Investable Market Indexes 
methodology and were not subject to the transition methodology.  
The 'Small Cap Index Inclusion Factor' is not used for the computation of the MSCI 
Emerging Markets and AC Small Cap Indexes, MSCI Small Cap Value and Growth, 
MSCI Provisional Small Cap and MSCI Small Cap Sectors Indexes, as these are all 
constructed using  the Global Investable Market Indexes methodology and were not 
subject to the transition methodology.  
The list of index constituents as of time t should be considered in the calculation.  
Effectively this figure represents the shares at the close on t, and does not include 
any of the effects of corporate actions due at the open of the market the next day.  
The closing market capitalization uses today's price, t, as it represents the market 
capitalization at the close of the calculation day t. 
1.5 SECURITY INDEX OF PRICE IN LOCAL  
The security Index of Price is distributed in MSCI daily and monthly security 
products [It represents the price return from period to period by utilizing the 
concept of an index of performance with an arbitrary base value. The index of price 
is fully adjus ted for capital changes and is expressed in local currency.

* ICIt is the Internal Currency Index of price currency at time t. The ICI is different than 
1 when a country changes the internal value of its currency (e.g. from Turkish Lira to 
New Turkish Lira - ICI = 1,000,000).  
* ICIt-1 is the Internal Currency Index of price currency at time t -1. 
 
(*) From June 1 2007  to May 31 2008, to calculate the standard or small cap index 
market capitalization (except for FM countries and China A), the security market

subject to the transition methodology.  
1.6 NOTE ON INDEX CALCULATION IN LOCAL CURRENCY  
The MSCI Country and Regional Indexes are calculated in local currency as well as 
in USD. The concept of a "local currency" calculation excludes the impact of 
currency fluctuations.  
Note that for a country index, the local currency index will not be the same as an 
index calculated with the official currency of that country, if there is more than one 
currency of listing.  
All currencies of listing are considered in the index calculation in local currency 
where current prices t and previous day prices t-1 are converted into USD using the 
same exchange rate (exchange rate t-1) in the numerator and denominator. As a 
consequence, the FX factor drops out of the equation.  
The USD calculation includes exchange rates at t and t -1. Therefore, the local 
currency calculation only represents the price appreciation or depreciation of the 
securities, whereas the USD calculation also accounts for the performance of the 
currency (or currencies) relative to the USD.  
1.7 CONVERSION OF INDEXES INTO ANOTHER CURRENCY  
An index can be calculated into any currency by converting the index in USD into 
the selected currency using the formula below.  
If the base date of the index is prior to the start date of the currency, the indexes 
should be rebased and converted using the following formula:  
  
IndexLevelinCurrency t=100 *IndexLevelinUSD t
IndexLevelinUSD currency _base _date*FXrate t
FXrate currency _base _date 
 
Note that 100 in the formula is the base value. This base value can be different 
than 100 (e.g. 1000 depending on the indexes).  
 
* If the base date of the index is equal or posterior to the start date of the currency, the 
indexes should be converted only, using the following formula:  
 
IndexLevelinCurrency t=IndexLevelinUSD t*FXrate t
FXrate index _base _date 
 
Example:  
Calculation of the The World Index in EUR as of October 20, 1999:  
Note that the start date of EUR is 31 -Dec-1998  
 
The World Index in USD as of 31 -Dec-98 = 1,149.951577  
The World Index as of 20 - Oct- 99 = 1,224.048387  
FxRate EUR vs USD as of 31 -Dec- 98 = 0.8516074  
FxRate EUR vs USD as of 20 -Oct-99 = 0.9279451  
 
WorldIndexinEUR 10/20/99=100 *WorldIndexinUSD 10/20/99
WorldIndexinUSD 31/12/98*EURvsUSDRate 10/20/99
EURvsUSDRate 12/31/98=
100 *1224 .048387
1149 .951577*0.9279451
0.8516074=115 .985 
  
 2 MSCI Daily  Total Return (DTR) Index Methodology  
Total return indexes  measure the market performance, including price performance 
and income from regular cash distributions (cash dividend payments or capital 
repayments). Regular cash distributions paid out of share capital or capital 
contribution reserves are treated in the same manner as regular cash dividends 
paid out of retained earnings. This income is reinvested in the index and thus 
makes up part of the total index performance.  
MSCI's Daily Total Return  (DTR) methodology reinvests regular cash distributions 
in indexes on the ex -date of such distributions. Regular cash distributions are not 
considered in price indexes, except for special dividends and capital repayments 
deemed extraordinary in certain circumstances described below.  
The standard Daily Total Return (DTR) Indexes are calculated and distributed on a 
daily basis. The indexes are available in USD and local currency (no currency 
impact), with gross and net total return.

2.1.6  CURRENCY  
For index calculations, all dividends are converted into USD at the spot rate of the 
ex date.  
2.1.7  NUMBER OF SHARES AND INDEX WEIGHTING FACTOR  
A dividend amount is expressed per share entitled to the dividend. Since the day 
before the ex -date is the last day on which the share is entitled to the dividend, the 
total dividend per security reinvested into an index is equal to the number of shares 
at the close of the ex -date -1 multiplied by the dividend per share.  
In addition, a weighting factor of a security in the index is applied to the total 
dividend amount to be reinvested. This can be the Domestic Inclusion Factor (DIF), 
the Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF), the Value Inclusion Factor (VIF), the Growth 
Inclusion  Factor (GIF) or any inclusion factor considered in the price index 
calculation.  
2.2 REINVESTMENT METHODOLOGY  
Gross Daily Total Return  
This series approximates the maximum possible reinvestment of regular cash 
distributions (cash dividends or capital repayments). The amount reinvested is the 
cash distributed to individuals resident in the country of the company, but does not 
include tax c redits.  
Net Daily Total Return  
This series approximates the minimum possible reinvestment of regular cash 
distributions.  Provided that the regular capital repayment is not subject to 
withholding tax, the reinvestment in the Net Daily Total Return is free of withholding 
tax. Effective December 1, 2009, t he regular cash dividend is reinvested after 
 deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the company's 
country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. MSCI uses different 
withholding taxes depending if the indexes are international or domestic:  
* International indexes: the maximum rate applicable to non -resident institutional 
investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties.  
* Domestic indexes: the maximum rate applicable to resident institutional 
investors  
For more information on how taxes are applicable to dividends, please refer to the 
Appendix for details about the withholding tax rates for the various countries.  
For Chinese securities with foreign listing, which pay cash dividends in RMB, MSCI 
will use Offshore exchange rate (CNH) for reinvestment in the MSCI Daily Total 
Return Indexes. However, historical correction of cash dividends reinvested prior to 
April 1, 2018 for such securities will continue to be reflected in CNY.  
For China A - Stock connect securities, dividend reinvestment will use Offshore 
exchange rate (CNH).  
2.2.1  TIMING OF REINVESTMENT  
The amount of an announced regular cash distribution is reinvested on the ex -date 
of such distribution on its principal exchange. For securities trading on more than 
one exchange, MSCI uses the ex -date at the exchange from which MSCI sources 
the security's  price.  
If a security does not trade on the ex-date or on the scheduled reinvestment date of 
the regular cash distribution , the reinvestment is postponed to the day when the 
security resumes trading. The scheduled reinvestment date of a dividend can be a 
date later than the dividend ex -date in cases including, but not limited to a late 
dividend or a dividend correction.

There are two principal guidelines in regards to cash distributions reinvestments:  
* A cash distribution - in the form of regular cash dividend or regular capital 
repayment - is reinvested among all the constituents in an index. It is not 
considered in the MSCI Price indexes. Note that these distributions are taken 
into account in the underlying security's yield calculation.  
* A special cash dividend that is unusually large, i.e. greater than or equal to 5% 
of the security cum price, or a capital repayment deemed to be extraordinary 
i.e. unlikely to recur on a regular basis, is reinvested by applying a PAF and is 
hence taken int o account in MSCI Price indexes as well as in the MSCI DTR 
Indexes.  
These guidelines are discussed in greater detail below.  
2.2.3  DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A REINVESTMENT ONLY  
The following cash distributions are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Index:  
Regular Cash Dividend  
A regular cash dividend is a distribution of cash made by a company to its 
shareholders and is paid out of operating profits or retained earnings. Regular cash 
dividends, regardless of their size, are reinvested on the ex -date in the MSCI DTR 
Indexes.  
Regular Capital Repayment  
 A capital repayment or return of capital is characterized by a cash distribution from 
the company's share capital or capital surplus to its shareholders. A capital 
repayment, regardless of its size, is considered as regular, if the cash distribution is 
in lieu of a regular cash dividend, or is in line with the dividend policy of the 
company or with the historical cash distributions. Provided that the capital 
repayment is not subject to withholding tax, the reinvestment in the MSCI DTR 
Indexes is free of wit hholding tax.  
In Taiwan, a cash distribution paid out of capital surplus is considered as regular 
unless specified by the company that the distribution is deemed to be 
extraordinary. The cash distribution is reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes. 
Regarding the withholding tax treatment, please refer to sub -section 2.3.7.2.1 
below.  
Optional Dividend  
In the case of an optional dividend, the company offers shareholders the choice of 
receiving the dividend either in cash or in shares. However, shareholders  electing 
the cash option may receive the dividend consideration in cash or shares, or some 
combination of cash and shares.  
MSCI assumes that shareholders receive the default distribution. If no default 
distribution is available, MSCI assumes that shareholders elect the cash option.  
MSCI therefore reinvests the dividend amount on the ex -date in the MSCI DTR 
Indexes. Please ref er to the section 4.3 of the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology 
book for more information regarding optional dividends treatment.  
Interest on Capital  
The 'interest on capital' dividend is a cash payment to shareholders accounted for 
as a pre -tax interest expense by the company. The balance sheet and the book 
value do not change. Interests on capital are common in Brazil.  
2.2.4  DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A REINVESTMENT OR IN A PRICE ADJUSTMENT  
The dividends below are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Index if the dividend impact 
on the cum price is less than 5%.  
However, if the impact is greater than or equal to 5%, the dividend will be reflected 
in the MSCI Index through a price adjustment.  
Special/Extraordinary Cash Dividend  
The company declares the dividend as special or extraordinary . It is funded by a 
special event or from extraordinary profits. MSCI may consider irregular and 
 unusually large dividends as special even if they are not declared as such by the 
company.  
Special cash dividends that are smaller than 5% of the cum price of the underlying 
security  are reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes, but are not included in the yield 
calculation, unless they are paid for at least three consecutive years.  
Special cash dividends that are greater than or equal to 5% of the market price of 
the underlying security on the date the event is announced in "confirmed" status  
are reinvested in the MSCI Indexes through an adjustment on the ex -date. A PAF 
using the gross dividend amount is applied to the MSCI Price Indexes, the MSCI 
Gross DTR Indexes and the MSCI Net DTR Indexes on the ex -date of the special 
cash dividend. Note that MSCI will not cancel the PAF implementation if the size of 
the special dividend becomes smaller than 5% after it has been announced in 
"confirmed" status.  
For special cash dividends that are greater than or equal to 5% of the market price 
and subject to a withholding tax, as defined in Section 2.3.7.2 , MSCI reinvests a 
negative amount corresponding to the withholding tax in the MSCI Net DTR 
Indexes only.  This negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF 
on the ex -date of the special cash dividend.  
Any special cash dividend, distributed for at least three consecutive years, is taken 
into account in the yield calculation of the underlying security, regardless of its 
size.  
Commemorative Dividend (memorial)  
A company declares a dividend as commemorative/memorial . The funds come 
from extraordinary profit or cash generated by a special event.  
Retroactive/Arrears Dividend  
Retroactive dividends are paid in Italy when a company has to pay a dividend to 
revenue -guaranteed (RISP) shares to make up for previous years' non -payments.  
Special Dividend to Non -Domestic Shareholders  
A company pays its non -domestic shareholders a bonus dividend to compensate 
for the tax credit distributed to domestic shareholders. This is a common practice 
in New Zealand.  
2.2.5  DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN A PRICE ADJUSTMENT ONLY  
A PAF is applied to the security in the MSCI Price Indexes, the MSCI Gross DTR 
Indexes and the MSCI Net DTR Indexes, in the following cases:  
 Stock Dividend (stock bonus/gratis issue)  
The company issues shares at no direct cost to the shareholders. The funds are 
taken out from the current year's earnings. In the case of a stock bonus/gratis 
issue, the company distributes a part of the reserves (retained earnings from 
previous years) to its shareholders.  
For Taiwanese and Indian stock dividends subject to withholding  and capital gain s 
tax respectively , MSCI reinvests a negative amount corresponding to the tax  
amount  in the MSCI Net DTR Indexes only. This negative reinvestment is reflected 
simultaneously with the PAF on the ex -date of the stock dividend.  
Extraordinary Capital Repayment  
Capital repayments that are deemed to be extraordinary compared to the dividend 
policy of the company or to the historical cash distributions are reinvested in the 
MSCI Indexes through an adjustment. A PAF using the gross capital repayment 
amount , regardless of its size, is applied to the security's market price  on the ex -
date.  
 
Dividend Paid in Shares of another Company  
The company distributes stock of another company as a dividend. The number of 
shares held remains the same, but the price will decrease by the value of the 
distributed security.  
MSCI considers other cash payments related to Corporate Events, such as 
mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, etc. on a case -by-case basis.  
2.3 PROCESSING RULES  
2.3.1  DIVIDEND DATA  
Raw dividend data is provided by multiple electronic data feeds and is checked for 
completeness and correctness. MSCI's Daily Total Return process requires that 
dividends be confirmed by at least two distinct data sources. Most dividends are 
received and validated through electronic feeds, but some dividends may require 
confi rmation from other sources, such as stock exchanges or the company. In 
addition, MSCI monitors securities for which a dividend is expected based on 
previous dividend announcement frequency, but which has not yet been received 
through the regular data sourc es. 
 2.3.2  CORPORATE ACTIONS  
A corporate action, which changes the number of shares outstanding for a 
company, may take place between the dividend's announcement date and its ex -
date. As the number of shares on the day preceding the ex -date is used to 
calculate the dividend amount to be reinvested, MSCI adjusts the dividend to 
reflect the number of shares on that day.  
Following certain corporate events, the number of shares used in MSCI Index 
calculations on the cum date may include shares that are not issued yet or that are 
not entitled to the dividend. In those cases, MSCI reinvests the dividend on the ex -
date as if a ll shares included in MSCI Index calculations were entitled to the 
dividend.  
2.3.3  LATE DIVIDENDS  
A late dividend is a dividend that is only known after its ex -date. It is processed 
under the correction policy as described in sub -section 2.3.4  below . 
2.3.4  CORRECTIONS  
A dividend that has been reinvested may need to be amended, due to an error in its 
ex-date, in the dividend amount, or in the dividend currency. MSCI will give advance 
notification for dividend corrections that are received after their ex -date. 
Consequently, the correction in the index will be postponed to the next business 
day following the reception and announcement of the information.  
The following rules apply:  
* Action is taken only if the error is discovered within 12 months of the ex date.  
* In the case of a correction, MSCI uses the number of shares at the close of the 
cum date.  The spot rate of the reinvestment date is used for currency 
conversion.  
* A historical correction is applied to all indexes impacted by more than 50 basis 
points1 if the impact on a country or World / EM industry group index is over 50 
basis points. Starting December 1, 2010, for the MSCI Frontier Markets Indexes 
(including MSCI GCC Countries Indexes), there will be a historical correction 
only if the impact on the  MSCI Frontier Markets region is over 50 basis points.  
 
1 The 50 basis  point limit is linked to the price index correction policy and will be revised accordingly to reflect 
any changes in this policy.  
 * The security that needs a dividend correction may have changed its status for 
index inclusion between the ex -date and the correction date. For example, this 
may be due  to the security's subsequent exclusion from the index, or a change in its 
industry or country classification. Applying the correction with the current status may 
reinvest dividends into the wrong index. If there is a change in the security's index 
inclusion status between the ex -date and the correction date, no correction amount 
will be reinv ested.  
2.3.5  PAYMENT DEFAULT  
A correction is applied when a dividend is declared unpaid (payment default). This 
may result in a negative reinvestment. Past index levels are not corrected.  
The following rules apply:  
* Action is taken only if the payment default is discovered within 12 months of 
the ex -date and is in line with the price index correction policy, where MSCI 
applies a 12 month correction period.  
* MSCI uses the number of shares effective at the close of the original cum date. 
The default amount is reinvested on the next business day following the 
reception and confirmation of at least two distinct data sources. . The spot rate 
of the reinvestment da te is used for currency conversion.  
2.3.6  COUNTRY EXCEPTIONS  
Japan:  
Many Japanese companies declare their dividends after the ex -date. As estimated 
dividends are available before the ex -date and are broadly used, an estimation of 
the dividend is reinvested on the ex -date. When a company does not declare an 
estimated dividend, MSCI uses the previous year's dividend amount from the same 
period as the estimation. Should the difference between the estimated and ratified 
dividend amount warrant correction, it will be processed as a payment default 
(reinvestment without correctin g past index levels) on the next business day 
following the reception date from the data sources.  
Korea:  
Many Korean companies declare their dividends after their ex -date. As no 
estimated dividends provided by the companies are available before the ex -date, 
the dividends are reinvested on the next business day following the reception and 
confirmation of at le ast two distinct data sources (in accordance with the section 
2.3.1 ). 
 These reinvestments after the ex -date do not trigger any correction of the index 
levels.  
MSCI uses the number of shares effective on the day prior to the ex -date to 
reinvest the dividend.  
In the rare case of Korean companies declaring their dividends prior to their ex -
date, MSCI reinvests dividends into the MSCI DTR Indexes on the day the security 
is quoted ex -dividend on its principal exchange (in accordance with the section 
2.2.1 ).  
Should the dividend amount for Korean companies change following approval by 
the shareholders at the general meeting, MSCI will reinvest the difference between 
the amount initially announced by the company and the final amount approved by 
the shareholders.  This does not trigger any correction of past index levels.  
Starting December 2014, for dividends with an ex date from December 2014 
onwards, MSCI will transition to the enhanced methodology for Korean dividends, 
as per the following:  
Under the enhanced methodology, MSCI will reinvest an estimated dividend 
amount for Korean securities on the ex -date of the dividend.  
The estimate will be calculated as the previous year's dividend amount from the 
same period, adjusted by any capital changes if necessary. If no dividend was paid 
from the same period in the previous year or an estimated dividend amount is not 
available, M SCI will reinvest the dividend amount of zero.  
Once a Korean company announces the actual dividend amount, MSCI will reinvest 
on the next business day following reception of data from MSCI's sources, all 
differences between the estimated and ratified dividend amount, if any, in the MSCI 
DTR Indexes wit hout correcting index levels.  
These estimates will be used for the calculation of the dividend yield as if the 
amounts were not estimates.  
Singapore:  
Some companies in Singapore, for example Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), 
pay advanced cash distributions at the time of placement of new shares, in order 
to ensure fairness to the existing shareholders. This distribution is a part of the 
regular qua rterly cash dividends announced by the companies. If an estimated 
amount or range of dividend amount is declared by the company before the ex -
date, MSCI reinvests the estimated amount or lower range of the dividend amount 
 in MSCI DTR Indexes on the day the security is quoted ex -dividend on its principal 
exchange (in accordance with the section 2.2.1).  
Should the dividend amount change after the ex -date following company 
announcement, MSCI will reinvest the difference between the amount initially 
announced by the company and the final amount on the next business day 
following the reception and confirmati on of at least two distinct data sources. 
These reinvestments after the ex -date do not trigger any correction of past index 
levels.  
USA: Redemption Right  
When a company redeems shares distributed to shareholders due to a poison pill 
rights issue (applies mainly in USA), there may be a change in the company's 
capital structure. In this case MSCI will apply a price adjustment.  
2.3.7  TAXES ON DIVIDENDS  
Shareholders may be taxed on dividend payments.  Tax rates vary depending on 
the company's and shareholder's country of domicile.  Tax data is monitored on a 
regular basis and is updated when necessary.  
2.3.7.1  TAX CREDIT  
A tax credit related to a dividend can be considered as a reimbursement of tax 
already received by the fiscal administration. In countries operating under an 
imputation tax system, a company's annual earnings are taxed before distribution 
to the shareholde rs, and then the shareholders pay taxes on the dividend. Some 
countries operating under an imputation tax system provide shareholders with a 
tax credit to offset the amount of the tax they would otherwise owe in respect of 
the dividend.2 MSCI does not take into account the amount of a tax credit in 
calculating either gross or net dividends.  
2.3.7.2  WITHHOLDING TAX  
A withholding tax related to a dividend is a tax on the income of the shareholder 
withheld by the company when the dividend is paid to a shareholder. The 
withholding tax rate depends on the tax status of the shareholder. MSCI uses the 
maximum withholding t ax rate applicable to institutional investors in calculating 
 
2 Singapore and Malaysia completely migrated to a one -tier tax system from imputation system effective 
January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2014 respectively. Under a one -tier or single -tier tax system, a company pays 
a tax on its taxable income and shareholders are not charged with a tax on dividends paid to them by the 
company.   
 MSCI net dividends. A non -resident shareholder must also pay taxes on dividends 
in his/her domestic country as part of his/her income taxes. Countries may 
eliminate this double taxation by signing 'bi -lateral' double taxation treaties.  
MSCI uses companies' country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend 
withholding tax rates in calculating the net dividends and the MSCI Net DTR 
Indexes. In cases where the withholding tax rate in the company's country of 
incorporation is highe r than the MSCI company's country of classification as 
determined in accordance to Appendix III of the MSCI Global Investable Markets 
Indexes Methodology, MSCI will make a specific analysis to determine the actual 
withholding tax rate applied to non -reside nt institutional investors.  
Companies' country of incorporations are reviewed on a quarterly  basis and 
changes to companies' withholding tax rates, if any, are  announced and 
implemented simultaneously with the  respective Index Review.  
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR International Indexes, MSCI uses the 
withholding tax rate applicable to non -resident institutional investors that do not 
benefit from double taxation treaties.  
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR Domestic Indexes, MSCI uses the 
withholding tax rate applicable to domestic institutional investors.  
Provided that the regular capital repayment is not subject to withholding tax, the 
reinvestment in the MSCI Net DTR is free of withholding tax.  
NOTE: MSCI applies a weighted average withholding tax rate to the total cash 
amount distributed by a company when:  
- a portion of the cash dividend amount is subject to a different withholding 
tax rate. Refer to the Appendix 6 for more details on withholding tax 
applicable to dividends paid by REITs.  
- two or more cash distributions paid by the same company are ex on the 
same day but subject to different withholding tax rates.  
2.3.7.2.1  COUNTRY EXCEPTIONS  
Australian Dividends  
Some Australian companies pay their dividends with franking credits attached in 
order to pass on to investors the value of any tax that the company has already 
paid on its profits. Dividends can be fully franked, partially franked or unfranked. 
Foreign non -resident investors are subject to the Australian dividend withholding 
tax on the unfranked portion of a dividend. However, foreign non -resident investors 
are not subject to the Australian dividend withholding tax on the unfranked portion 
 of the dividend to the extent that it is declared as conduit foreign income3 by 
Australian companies, or on the franked portion of the dividend.  
In the calculation of the MSCI Net DTR International Indexes for Australian 
dividends, MSCI uses the withholding tax rate4 applicable to foreign non -resident 
institutional investors on the unfranked portion of the dividend that is not 
designated as conduit foreign income. MSCI does not apply withholding tax rate on 
the franked portion of the dividend or the unfranked portion of the dividend 
declared to be conduit foreign income.  
In the case that the franking percentage and/or the conduit foreign income not 
publicly available prior to the ex -date, the franking percentage and/or the conduit 
foreign income will be assumed zero correspondingly.  
The effective withholding tax rate being applied to the Australian dividends in the 
MSCI Net DTR International Indexes is as follows.  
Effective withholding tax rate = Australia default withholding tax rate x (100% - 
franking % - conduit foreign income %)

Indian Stock Dividends  
In India, shares issued as part of a stock dividend (of shares in the same company) 
are subject to capital gains tax of up  to 20%. MSCI reinvests a negative amount on 
the ex -date of the stock dividend corresponding to the capital gains tax in the MSCI 
 
3 Conduit foreign income is foreign income received by a foreign resident via an Australian corporate tax 
entity, and is that income which would ordinarily not be taxed under the relevant Australian tax laws (source: 
Australian Government, The Treasury).  
4 Please refer to the Appendix for the latest withholding tax rate for Australia.  
 Net Daily Total Return (DTR) Indexes only. The negative amount per share will be 
calculated as follows:  
Negative amount per share = (Closing price of the security on the ex -date * Shares 
Issued * 20%) / Shares before  
The negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF on the ex -date 
of the stock dividend.  
Taiwanese Stock Dividends  
In Taiwan, stock dividends can be paid out from capital surplus or retained 
earnings. The portion of stock dividends paid out of retained earnings is subject to 
the default withholding tax rate against the par value of each new share. The 
portion of stock dividends paid out of capital surplus is not subject to a withholding 
tax.  
To take into account this withholding tax in the MSCI Indexes, MSCI reinvests a 
negative amount corresponding to the withholding tax in the MSCI Net DTR 
Indexes only.  
This negative amount of the withholding tax is calculated using the following 
formula.  
Withholding tax of Taiwanese stock dividend = Number of shares received which 
are subject to the withholding tax x par value of each share x Taiwanese default 
withholding tax rate5. 
This negative reinvestment is reflected simultaneously with the PAF on the ex -date 
of the stock dividend.  
Taiwanese Capital Repayments  
In Taiwan, the cash distributions paid out from the types of capital surplus which 
are originally contributed by shareholders are not subject to any withholding tax. 
Otherwise, the cash distributions paid out from the types of capital surplus not 
originall y contributed by shareholders are subject to a withholding tax. The cash 
distribution paying out of the capital surplus originally contributed by shareholders 
is therefore reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes free of withholding tax. Otherwise, 
the cash dist ribution paying out from the equity capital not originally contributed by 
shareholders is reinvested with the default withholding tax rate. In the case that a 
Taiwanese company does not clarify the source of capital surplus, the cash 
distribution is reinve sted in the MSCI DTR Indexes free of withholding tax.  
 
5 Please refer to the Appendix for the latest withholding tax rate for Taiwan  
 Thailand Cash Dividends  
In Thailand, the Board of Investment ("BOI") provides tax exemptions to certain 
companies that generate profit from promoting investment activity in Thailand.  
These companies can be classified as BOI promoted companies and are referred 
to as operating "un der BOI privilege." When a company under BOI privilege 
distributes dividends, the dividends derived from business profit generated by BOI 
related business can be exempted from withholding tax. However, Non -Voting 
Depositary Receipt (NVDR) holders are not e ntitled to the withholding tax 
exemption.  
MSCI does not take into account such tax exemption in calculating net dividends. 
That is, MSCI does not differentiate dividends derived from business profit under 
BOI privilege and non -BOI privilege. MSCI will therefore reinvest the full cash 
dividend amou nt with the default withholding tax rate in the MSCI DTR Indexes.  
 2.3.8  DEFINITIONS  
* Announcement date  - the date on which the company announces its next 
dividend payment.  
* Reception date - the date on which the information about the dividend is 
received by MSCI from its data sources.  
* Record date - the date on which an individual must own shares (be the holder 
of record) in order to receive a declared dividend or capital gains distribution.  
* Ex-date - the first day on which, if an investor buys the security, the security no 
longer carries the right to the declared dividend.  
  
 3 Index Calculation for the MSCI Blended Index es 
MSCI blend indexes are calculated by combining published index levels 
(component indexes) according to methodological rules. The returns of the 
component indexes are linearly combined in a fixed proportion known at the time 
of rebalance.

 Appendix I: Sunday Intermediary Index Calculation 
for Monday -Friday Index Calculation Methodology  
Calculation Methodology  
A selected list of MSCI Indexes is calculated on Sunday to reflect the performance 
of the markets open on this day.  
In order to preserve compatibility with the other MSCI Indexes, which are calculated 
from Monday to Friday, MSCI uses the concept of a Monday pre -opening 
(intermediate) calculation for the Sunday calculation. The Sunday index 
performances capture the price changes and reflect corporate events effective on 
this day.  
In case of corporate events occurring on Sundays and where a Price Adjustment 
Factor (PAF) is needed, the PAF is applied to the market price of the security on 
Sunday and Monday. If the security does not trade on Monday, the Sunday closing 
market price is carried forward to Monday, including the PAF.  
Changes in the security's number of shares, FIFs and/or DIFs due to corporate 
events occurring on Sunday are implemented as of the close of Monday, 
regardless of whether the corporate event requires the application of a PAF on 
Sunday or not.  
The index constituent list is the same as the one to be used for the Monday 
calculation.  
WM/Refinitiv  spot FX rates as of the previous Friday is carried forward to the 
Sunday in order to perform the index calculation in USD.  
No dividends are reinvested on Sundays. Consequently, the Daily Total Return 
(DTR) index performances for Sunday will be equal to the ones of the price index.  
 
The chain -linking for these indexes can be summarized as follows:  
* Sunday's daily index performance is computed by comparing Sunday's 
adjusted prices and the previous Friday's unadjusted prices  
* Monday's daily index performance is computed, as currently, by comparing 
Monday's adjusted prices and the previous Friday's unadjusted prices

 Appendix II: Annualized Traded Value Ratio (ATVR) 
and Annual Traded Value  
Calculation Methodology  
The Annualized Traded Value Ratio (ATVR) is used to measure liquidity. MSCI uses 
ATVR as an investability criterion to determine the inclusion of securities into the 
MSCI Indexes.  
MSCI distributes ATVR fields on a monthly basis. Below the fields that are 
distributed are defined. Note that the data used by MSCI during the index reviews 
may differ from the data distributed.  
 
ATVR Calculation Formulas  
 
1.  Monthly Median Traded Value  
Taking the median screens out extreme daily trading volumes:  
 
Mont hlyMedianTradedValue Mont hN=
MedianTradedValueUSD Mont hN*NbOfSecurityTradingDays Mont hN 
 
Where:  
* MedianTradedValueUSD Mont hN=Median [DailySecurityTradedValueUSD Mont hN]  
* DailySecurityTradedValueUSD t=DailySecurityTradedVolume t*PricePerS hare t/FXrat et 
* NbOfSecurityTradingDaysMont hN is the number of days in the month where the 
security has been traded  
* DailySecurityTradedVolumet represents the number of securities traded during 
the day t  
* PricePerS haret is the price per share of the security s at time t.  
* FXratet is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs. USD at time t. It is the 
value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
 
 
 
 
 2.  Monthly Traded Value Ratio (MTVR)  
Dividing the monthly median traded value of a security by its free float -adjusted 
security market capitalization at the end of the month gives the monthly median 
traded value ratio  
MTVR _FIFAdj Mont hN=Mont hlyMedianTradedValue Mont hN
SecurityFIFAdjustedMarketCapUSD Mont hN_endday 
 
MTVR _DIFAdj Mont hN=Mont hlyMedianTradedValue Mont hN

Where:  
* SecurityFIFAdjustedMarketCapUSDMont hN_endday is the security market 
capitalization at the end of the month, 
SecurityAdjustedMarketCapUS DMont hN_endday , adjusted with FIF  
* SecurityDIFAdjustedMarketCapUSDMont hN_endday is the security market 
capitalization at the end of the month, 
SecurityAdjustedMarketCapUS DMont hN_endday  , adjusted with DIF

iN,N-1...N-11 
ATVR _DIFAdj Mont hN=  MTVR _DIFAdj Mont h_i
iN,N-1...N-11 
 
The ATVR is not calculated when less than 12 months of monthly traded value 
ratios are available.  
 
4.  Annual Traded Value  
The annual traded value is the sum of the monthly median traded values.  
 
AnnualTradedValue Mont hN=  Mont hlyMedianTradedValue Mont h_i
iN,N-1...N-11 
 
 The Annual Traded Value is not calculated when less than 12 months of monthly 
median traded values are available.  
5.  Aggregated information  
In the calculation of the aggregated information, the trading volumes in depository 
receipts associated with that security, such as ADRs or GDRs, are also considered. 
It is obtained by summing up the ATVR of each listing.  
Aggregated FIF/DIF adjusted ATVR is the sum of FIF/DIF adjusted ATVR of K 
securities that are linked by the same issuer, share class and share type:  
 
AggregatedATVR _FIFAdj Mont hN=  ATVR _FIFAdj Mont hN,linkedSec _i

Aggregated ATVR is calculated even if less than 12 months of monthly median 
traded values are available for one, several or all listings. When less than 12 
months are available for a given listing, MSCI will use the ATVR based on the 
monthly median traded values for the last 6 months, 3 months or 1 month for that 
listing (depending on data availability).  
The Aggregated Annual Traded Value includes trading volumes in depositary 
receipts or other alternate listings associated with that security. It is obtained by 
summing up the Annual Traded Values of each listing:

 Appendix III: Exchange Rates    
Closing Spot Rates  
Until December 30, 1993, MSCI used the exchange rates taken from the Reuters 
multi contributor pages at 4.00PM CET.  
Since December 31st, 1993, MSCI has been using the WM/Refinitiv  Closing Spot 
Rates, taken at 4PM London time, for all the countries for which it provides indexes, 
except for the Latin American countries. At the time, MSCI established a special 
foreign exchange policy for Latin American countries in view of the risks o f 
important movement of currencies in some of these markets between the 4PM 
London closing and the close of the respective Latin American markets.  
Starting July 26, 2000, MSCI began to use the WM/Refinitiv  Closing Spot Rates, 
taken at 4PM London time, for all the countries it provides indexes including Latin 
American countries.  
In case WM/Refinitiv  does not provide spot rates for specific markets on given 
days (for example Christmas Day and New Year Day), the previous business day's 
rates are used.  
MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. MSCI may 
under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange 
rates if MSCI determines that the WM/Refinitiv  rates are not reflective of market 
circumstances for a given currency on a particular day (for example divergence 
between onshore and offshore rates). In such circumstances, an announcement 
would be sent to clients with the related information. All such d eterminations are 
made by the MSCI Equity Index Committee (EIC).  If appropriate, MSCI may 
conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the 
most relevant exchange rate.  
Forward Rates  
MSCI uses the spot and 1 -month premium/discount as provided by WM/Refinitiv  to 
compute the 1 -month Forward exchange rates. These values are taken at 4PM 
London time.  
If a Forward rate is missing, the previous business day's Forward 
premium/discount will be added to the current business day's Spot rate (if 
available, else the previous business day's Spot rate will be used) . 
In cases where WM/Refinitiv  does not provide forward rates for specific markets 
on a given day (for example Christmas Day and New Year Day), the previous 
business day's rates are used.  
 Appendix IV: Singapore & Malaysia - A History of 
Inclusion in the Emerging and Developed Markets 
Indexes  
 
Stock Markets  
Stock trading has a long history in Singapore dating back to the 1930's.  In 1960 
the Malayan Stock Exchange started trading shares publicly.  There were trading 
floors in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur linked as a single market.  When 
Singapore split fro m Malaysia the stock exchange continued to operate as one 
under the name Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore (SEMS).  In 1973 the 
accord that allowed for the convertibility at par between the Singapore Dollar and 
Malaysian Ringgit was terminated.  Thi s led to the separation of SEMS into the 
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) and the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES).  
Malaysian companies continued to trade heavily in Singapore.  
 
MSCI Indexes  
On December 1st 1972, the MSCI Singapore/Malaysia Index was added to the 
World Index.  The index was developed in cooperation with the Overseas -Chinese 
Banking Corporation, which published the same index under the name O.C.B.C. 
Index.  As is the case with other MSCI Indexes the purpose was to track those 
securities representative of Singapore.  However as approximately half the market 
capitalization and liquidity of the SES was due to Malaysian shares the index was 
designed to incorporate both Singaporean c ompanies as well as those Malaysian 
shares that traded in Singapore.  This aspect was different from other MSCI 
Indexes, as the norm is to only include domestically listed shares.  In light of the 
long integrated history of the Malay Peninsula and Singapor e, and the continued 
dual listing of shares, it was deemed to be more representative to include these 
Malaysian companies as representative of the opportunity set of the SES.  
MSCI launched its emerging market series on January 1, 1988.  Among other 
country indexes was an index of Malaysia with 59 securities.  As MSCI was now 
covering emerging markets the MSCI Mexico Index was pulled out of MSCI World.  
The World Index was to be  considered a developed market index.   
In 1989 the Malaysian government announced that Malaysian companies would be 
asked to delist their shares from the SES.  Previously the government had 
prohibited newly listed shares of Malaysian companies from listing on the SES.  In 
 November 1989, reacting to the Malaysian government announcement, MSCI 
initially announced its intention to remove Malaysian securities from the 
Singapore/Malaysia index.  The following month MSCI announced that the terms 
and timing of the Malaysian delist ing were too ambiguous.  As a result MSCI would 
take a wait and see approach prior to removing any Malaysian securities from the 
Singapore/Malaysia index.  As a result the Malaysian shares in the MSCI 
Singapore/Malaysia Index were effectively frozen or gra ndfathered.  Over time, 
some of these shares were no longer listed on Singapore but continued to be 
included in the index using the Ringgit price at which they were traded in Kuala 
Lumpur.  
In January 1992 MSCI announced a change.  The Singapore/Malaysia index was 
now composed of a representative sampling of Singaporean companies coupled 
with grandfathered Malaysian securities that used to trade in Singapore but were 
no longer trading there a s a result of the delisting requirement.  Malaysia was 
clearly an emerging market, for example its GDP per capita was $2,340 
considerably below that of Spain ($10,920), the lowest country that was currently in 
the MSCI World Index.  Nonetheless many develo ped market investors had 
historically purchased Malaysian companies as a result of some Malaysian 
companies being included in the MSCI World and EAFE Indexes.  Deleting all 
Malaysian companies from the developed market indexes could have been very 
disrupti ve to the markets.  As a result of this dilemma MSCI decided to add 
Malaysia as a country to the World and related developed market indexes while 
continuing to include Malaysia in the emerging market series.  One could not have 
a credible emerging market s eries without the continued inclusion of Malaysia in 
that series.  
Thus Malaysia was to be represented in both the developed and emerging market 
series.  At the time MSCI acknowledged that the existence of Malaysia in both the 
developed and emerging market series was less than ideal.  As of April 30th 1993 
Malaysia was fu lly added to the developed market series, resulting in the addition 
of approximately 40 securities.  This was because the MSCI Malaysia Index was 
designed to represent the profile of the entire Malaysian market whereas the 
current Malaysian stocks in the W orld and EAFE Indexes were selected to reflect 
the composition of those Malaysian stocks trading in Singapore. ACWI clients 
would not have to worry about double counting as Malaysia was represented at its 
appropriate market cap weight. The index of Singapo re represented the 
continuation of the Singapore/Malaysia index and therefore retains its base date of 
December 31, 1969.  Developed and emerging market indexes excluding Malaysia 
were calculated for those clients who preferred a different classification.  
  
The Asian Crisis  
The "Asian Crisis", starting in 1997 with the devaluation of the Thai Baht eventually 
spread to Malaysia.  On September 1st 1998 Malaysia imposed a series of 
restrictions on the convertibility of the Ringgit.  These controls effectively 
prohibited the repa triation of funds.  On Sept 4th, 1998 MSCI announced that 
effective Sept 30th Malaysia would be removed from the EAFE and World Indexes 
and that its status in EMF was under review.  In the MSCI announcement of the 
change it was stated "...the limitations in repatriating investment proceeds would 
seriously challenge the objective and integrity of the MSCI Developed Markets 
Indexes, were the Malaysian securities to remain in these indexes."  These 
restrictions imposed by the government of Malaysia thus ended th e legacy issue of 
Malaysian securities appearing in both the developed and emerging market series.  
On Sept 28th, 1998 MSCI announced that Malaysia would be removed from the 
MSCI EMF and ACWI Free series as of the close of November 30th, 1998.  As part 
of the capital controls imposed, foreign investors became obligated to hold 
Malaysian securities for a period of one -year commencing Sept 1st, 1998, before 
any possible capital repatriation.  The authorities also imposed a fixed exchange 
rate of 3.8 Ringgit to the US dollar.  The measures taken by the government along 
with the lack of transparency meant tha t Malaysia's inclusion in the Free series of 
indexes was no longer justified.  A discount of 30% was applied to the valuation of 
the MSCI Malaysia Index in US dollars, effective Sept 30th, 1998.  The discount was 
applied because market forces no longer det ermined the official exchange rate.   
On February 5th, 1999 MSCI announced that effective February 26th, 1999 the 
discount would be reduced to 15%.  This followed the Malaysian Government 
announcement on the previous day that it was alleviating the restrictions on the 
repatriation of investmen ts.   
As a result of the removal of the restrictions on the repatriation of capital, MSCI 
announced on August 12, 1999, the removal of the 15% discount effective August 
30, 1999.  On November 23, 1999, MSCI announced that Malaysia would be re -
included fully at 1 00% in the EMF and AC Free indexes as of May 31, 2000.  
MSCI Malaysia Indexes will be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Free 
(EMF) series and the MSCI All Country (AC) Free Indexes effective as of the close 
of 30th November, 1998 Of course Malaysia was not readmitted to the developed 
market series, as its inclusion there was a result of the previously explained 
anomaly.   
 
 Quick Facts  
Malaysia was part of the Developed Market indexes:  
* From December 1, 1972 to May 2, 1993, MSCI calculated a combined index, the 
Singapore/Malaysia index - due to the history of Malaysian securities trading in 
Singapore.  
* From May 3, 1993 up to the close of Sep 30, 1998, Malaysia was part of DM as 
an individual country (separated from Singapore).  
 
Malaysia has been part of the Emerging Market indexes from 1987 to present:  
* With a discount of 30% from Sep 30, 1998 to Feb 25, 1999  
* With a discount of 15% from Feb 26, 1999 to Aug 29, 1999  
* With no discount since Aug 30, 1999  
 
Malaysia has been part of the EMF index:  
* From 1987 to Nov 30, 1998  
* And since June 1, 2000   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Appendix V: Singapore and Singapore Free  
 
What is the difference between the MSCI Singapore Index and the MSCI 
Singapore Free Index; the MSCI EAFE Index and the MSCI EAFE Free Index; the 
MSCI World Index and the MSCI World Free Index?  
 
In the 1990s, Singapore enacted a system to prevent companies in strategic 
industries (mainly banks, airlines and the media) from being controlled by 
foreigners.  Certain shares had limits on the percent that could be purchased by 
foreigners. Once the limit was reached, these shares traded at a premium price. 
The MSCI Singapore Free Index used the prices at which foreigners could trade.  
MSCI also started calculating the regional indexes, MSCI World Free Index, MSCI 
EAFE Free Index and MSCI Pacific Free Index to include the MSCI Singapore Free 
Index as well as to reflect investment restrictions in some of the Nordic countries 
and Switzerla nd. The MSCI Singapore Index (non -free version) reflected the 
investment opportunities applicable to domestic investors.  
In May of 1999, the foreign ownership restrictions in Singapore were lifted and as 
of that date, the MSCI Singapore Index and MSCI Singapore Free Index and the 
corresponding regional developed market Free and non -Free indexes have had the 
same constituent market caps and performance. Only the absolute index levels 
continue to differ. MSCI will continue both the Free and Non -Free versions of MSCI 
Singapore Index, MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI World Index to reflect the differing 
history.

Notes : 
1. Used in the calculation of the MSCI Net Daily Total Return  (DTR) Indexes. 
Withholding tax rates used are the maximum rates  of the  company's country 
of incorporation applicable to institutional investors who do not benefit from 
double taxation treaties. Foreign rates  are used in the MSCI Net DTR 
International Indexes and Domestic rates are used in the MSCI Net DTR 
Domestic Indexes.  
 2. For Australian dividends, franking percentage and conduit foreign income 
are taken into consideration on calculation of the MSCI Net DTR Indexes. 
The actual withholding tax rate for an Australian dividend ranges from 0% to 
30%. For details, please refer to  the section 2.3.7.2.1.  
3. Interest on capital is subject to a 15% withholding tax.  
4. For the MSCI China Index, the dividend withholding tax rates are determined 
as follows:  
1) Companies incorporated within mainland China, including B -
Share and H -Share, are subject to a 10% withholding tax.  
2) Companies that are incorporated outside mainland China.  
2.1) Red -Chip and P -Chip are subject to a 0% withholding tax, 
unless the company publicly announces that it is a Chinese Tax 
Resident Enterprise and therefore subject to a withholding tax of 
10%.  
2.2) ADRs are subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless a specific 
withholding tax of 0% is announced by the companies.  
5. Dividends on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) are subject to a 10% 
withholding tax.  
6. Cash dividends paid by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom 
include a 10% tax credit. MSCI does not take into consideration the tax credit 
for both the gross and net dividend amounts. As there is no withholding tax 
in the United Kingdom, the gross and net amounts of the cash dividends to 
be reinvested in the MSCI Net Daily Total Return (DTR) indexes are equal.  
7. Dividends on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) are subject to a 10% 
withholding tax.  
8. Dividends on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are subject to a 15% 
withholding tax.  
9. Dividends on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are subject to a 30% 
withholding tax.  
10. PID components of dividends on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are 
subject to a 20% withholding tax  
11. Dividends paid by Independent Power Purchasers which are pass through 
items under an Implementation Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement or 
Energy Purchase Agreement and are required to be reimbursed by the 
 Central Power Purchasing Agency,  as defined by the government of 
Pakistan,  are subject to 7.5% withholding tax.  
12. If the dividend announcement explicitly mentions that the dividend relates to 
profits made from a previous year, the withholding tax rate in effect for the 
mentioned year will be appli ed instead (e.g. 13.75% for dividends paid from 
profits for financial year 2023)

Egypt  Egyptian 
Exchange  .CA EC XCAI  Auction close  The Closing Price is calculated according to the following criteria in order of priority:  
*             The price that achieves maximum traded volume.  
*             The price that leaves the lowest remaining inexecutable quantity.  
*             Average executable prices.  
 
The calculated price must meet the following conditions:  
1. (Total value traded during 3 months/ No. of trading days) * 0.5% or EGP 
300,000 for main market & EGP 150,000 for SMEs or its equivalent in foreign 
currencies, whichever is higher  
2. Achieving a minimum number of discrete sell brokers (N1), and the 
Minimum number of discrete buy brokers (M1), result in trades with at least (X1) 
number of broker firms participating, is classified as follows:  
* For the EGX30 index constituents (N1=3, M1=3 and X1=2).  
* For the EGX70EWI index constituents (N1=10, M1=10 and X1=5).  
* For the remaining securities (N1=15, M1=15and X1=5).  
If the above conditions are not met, no price will be shown in the TCP computed price 
portion and it will not be implemented and the trade -at-close session will take place 
on the latest MVWAP if available during the current trading session, or any previously 
announced closing price.  
First condition is calculated once every three months, and if the actual value is less 
than the value of the condition or its minimum, a new closing price is not calculated, 
and if it is greater than or equal to the value of the condition or its minimum, a  new 
closing price of the security is calculated on the basis of the VWAP.  
The latest MVWAP is defined as the moving VWAP for the last 30 minutes 
executions.  
In the absence of a calculated price to which the conditions apply and absence of 
latest MVWAP, the closing price of yesterday will be adopted.  
The effect of the private trades is excluded when calculating the indicated average 
trading.  
In the case of new security, the value specified for the closing price is equal to the 
minimum value of the condition.  2:30PM

In case of market closure or if a security does not trade on a specific day or a specific period, MSCI carries the latest available closing 
price to calculate its indexes . 
In case of market outage, MSCI will use the prices provided up to the point of the outage of that market for calculation of MSCI indexes on 
that day . If MSCI determines that another price is more appropriate based on the circumstances, an announcement would be sent to 
clients with the related information.  All such determinations are made by the MSCI Equity Index Committee (EIC).  
Special note for countries open on Saturday and/or Sunday:  
In the event that a security does not trade on a Monday but was traded on the previous Saturday and/or Sunday, the latest pri ce available 
during the weekend will be used for the Monday index calculation.  
In addition, a security that does not trade on Monday but traded ex corporate event during the previous weekend will have the  event 
reflected in the Monday index calculation.  
 
 Special note for Japanese securities:  
Japanese companies can be listed simultaneously on more than one stock exchange in Japan. A company may apply for delisting f rom 
one stock exchange while remaining listed in the other stock exchange(s). For such delisting, most Japanese stock exchanges g ive one 
month notice prior to the last trading date of the security. Should such delisting involve a change in primary exchange and/o r trigger a 
change in the price source, MSCI will source the price of the security from the new primary exchange two weeks af ter an announcement of 
delisting from the stock exchange.

 Appendix IX: MSCI Real Time Indexes  
 
MSCI currently calculates price, net and gross variants for approximately 9,000 
equity based indexes in real time as well as the FX Hedge, Currency, Short/Leveraged 
and Daily Hedged indexes. All MSCI Real Time Indexes are calculated based on the 
correspond ing end -of-day index calculation methodologies.  
MSCI disseminates real time indexes every 60 seconds or 15 seconds depending on 
the index type and its use in the marketplace.  On a daily basis for each real time 
index, MSCI will provide an Index Open value (IO) which will occur when the first 
security belonging to that index trades, an Index Update value (IU) which will occur 
throughout the day after the Index Open has been sent and an Index Close value (IC) 
which will be sent out as the last real time level and indicate the real time closing 
value.6 
 
Real Time Intraday Foreign Exchange Rates vs. Real Time Close Foreign Exchange 
Rates  
MSCI Real Time Indexes use the Reuters Multi Contributor FX Rates for all Index 
Open and Index Updates and MSCI applies the WM 4PM London time Closing Mid 
Rates for the Index Close.  
Mono -currency indexes which are indexes that have exposure to a single currency 
will have their Index Close value sent shortly after the underlying stock exchange(s) 
close and do not require the WM 4PM London closing rate to calculate the Index 
Close.  
Multi -currency indexes (which have exposure to multiple currencies) require the WM 
4PM London closing rate to calculate the Index Close.  Multi -currency indexes whose 
underlying stock exchanges close before the WM 4PM London rates are received will 
have th eir last Index Update sent shortly after the last underlying stock exchange 
closes and then will have their Index Close sent when the WM 4PM London Close is 
received.  Multi -currency indexes whose underlying stock exchanges close after the 
WM 4PM London ra tes are received will continue to use the Reuters Multi Contributor 
 
6 The real time Index Close could be different from the index value for the same index delivered in MSCI's end 
of-day product files due to due to post -market close data updates implemented (including but not limited to: 
updates for security prices, FX rates and interest rates) during the end -of-day calculation process. The official 
closing level of any MSCI index is the level distributed in MSCI's end -of-day product files.  
 FX rates for all Index Updates until the last underlying stock exchange closes and the 
Index Close is sent using the WM 4PM London Close.  
 
Real Time Intraday Security Pricing vs. Real Time Close Security Pricing  
Index Open and Index Update calculations use the last traded price available and the 
Index Close uses the official closing price or last trade as described in the MSCI 
Closing Prices Policy found in Appendix VII of this document.  
 
Input (Security Price, FX Rate, Interest Rate) and Output (calculated Index Level) 
Data filtering criteria  
MSCI has various filtering criteria set in place to minimize irregularities in MSCI's 
Real Time index levels calculations.  
MSCI's security price market filters exclude trades such as block sales and odd lots, 
among others. These types of trades are pre -excluded by default and not considered 
in the calculation of the MSCI Indexes as they may not reflect the prevailing market 
prices at the time of calculation.  
MSCI's security price, FX rate and interest rate threshold filters ensure that 
fluctuations above or below a certain threshold for these input data are checked prior 
to being included in the calculation of the MSCI Real Time Indexes. A similar logic is 
applied to any variations outside preset thresholds for the MSCI Real Time Index 
levels.  
Whenever an input data point is filtered, the relevant data point will be held and not 
used in MSCI's Real Time index levels calculations. Instead, the last known input data 
point before the filtered value will be used, until the filter is either accepted or 
rejected based on investigations, or the input data point falls back within the 
predefined threshold for inclusion or exclusion in the calculation of the MSCI Real 
Time index levels. For filtered output the last known MSCI Real Time Index level will 
be displayed until the filtered Index level is either accepted or rejected based on 
investigations or when the index level falls back within the predefined threshold.  
Thresholds for the above -mentioned filters may vary depending on external factors 
like market conditions for both input data and calculated Index levels.  
 
Real Time Cash Dividend Reinvestment  
Consistent with the Daily Total Return (DTR) end -of-day index calculation 
methodology, MSCI's real time DTR calculation will reinvest a dividend only if the 
 security paying the dividend trades on the ex -date. The dividend will be reflected in 
real time index calculations as soon as the security paying the dividend trades in real 
time.   If the security does not trade on the ex -date or on the scheduled reinvest ment 
date, the dividend reinvestment will be postponed to the day when the security 
resumes trading.  Late dividends or corrections will be treated in real time 
calculations consistent with the end -of-day DTR index calculation methodology. For 
more details  on MSCI's DTR methodology please refer to the Section 2.  
 
General Announcement Policy for Dividends  
Upcoming dividends to be reinvested in the MSCI DTR Indexes are announced prior 
to their reinvestment in the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File.  
Late dividends and dividend corrections that are received after their ex -date are 
reinvested or corrected in the MSCI DTR Indexes on the next business day following 
the reception date from the data sources. Therefore, there is at least one day's notice 
through the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File prior to their reinvestment and / or 
correction.  
In exceptional cases, MSCI will announce the treatment of dividends that are not pre -
announced in the MSCI Security Advanced Dividend File and are received by MSCI 
during market hours on their ex -date through an intraday option email 
announcement.  
 
Price Adjustment Factor (PAF) Announcements  
MSCI sends a Closing PAF announcement for all Real Time constituents that have a 
corporate event effective involving the calculation of a theo -cum PAF such as a 
special cash dividend, capital repayment or when a shareholder receives something 
other than the underlying  asset.   
 
The closing PAF announcement uses the closing price of the security having the 
corporate event and is used in the Index Close calculation.  The closing PAF value is 
sent shortly after the closing price of the security having the corporate event is 
received .  For more information on corporate events, please see the MSCI Corporate 
Event Methodology document.  
 
 Special Quotation (SQ)  
The MSCI Special Quotation (SQ) is a MSCI Index level that is calculated using 
Opening Prices for the Index constituents. Opening Prices are used collectively in a 
single index calculation regardless of the time of day the Opening Price became 
available.  
The SQ calculation occurs within the first 30 minutes after the relevant market is 
opened for trading.  
In case a security that did not trade within the first 30 minutes after the relevant 
market is opened, eventually trades, MSCI will re -issue the SQ calculation using the 
updated Opening Price.  
In case of market closure or if a security does not trade on the specific settlement 
day, MSCI carries the latest available closing price for the security or market in the 
SQ calculation.  
Constituents and weights are identical to the standard MSCI index upon which the 
SQ calculation is based.  
The SQ calculations are made on a custom calendar basis (typically on the third 
Friday of a calendar quarter).  
 
Intraday or Mid -day Calculations  
An Intraday or Mid -day Index level is calculated using security prices and Multi 
Contributor FX Rates extracted from MSCI's Real Time system as of pre-defined time 
of day  on each  calculation date. Security prices may include a mixture of official 
close prices according to MSCI's Closing Prices Policy (found in Appendix VII of this 
document) and Real Time last sale prices as of the calculation time. FX Rates are not 
official benchm arks set by any organization or agency. Security prices and FX Rates 
are subje ct to the filtering criteria mentioned above to ensure data quality and may 
not reflect the prevailing market prices at the time of the calculation. Security prices 
and FX Rates used in the Intraday or Mid -day Index level are not used for next day 
constitu ent weights or for any rebalancing algorithm that the relevant Index 
Methodology may employ.  
If interest rates are used based on relevant index methodology, input data filtering 
criteria (detailed before) are also applied.  
 
 
 Snapshots from Real Time  
A Snapshot Index level is a specific tick from MSCI's Real Time calculation feed as of 
hh:mm on the calculation date. MSCI's Real Time index calculations are performed 
either every 15 seconds or every 60 seconds and are load balanced so that the 
Snapshot I ndex level may come from any one of 60 seconds within the target 
minute.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Appendix X: Index Calculation Methodology Using 
Index Divisors  
INTRODUCTION  
An index level is calculated by multiplying the weighted average performance of the 
index constituents by the previous index level. This section presents an alternative 
way of calculating an index level (which is similar to the traditional way of valuing a  
portfolio), by simply multiplying asset constituent quantities by current prices, and 
adding up the results. The index divisor concept, introduced below, is central to this 
alternative index calculation.  
When calculating a security's performance on days with certain corporate events, a 
price adjustment factor (PAF) is needed to ensure historical price comparability. This 
factor often accounts for assets that contribute to the index performance for a day, 
such as rights offerings, spun -off companies or cash. In the alternative index 
calculation methodology described herein, the PAF is replaced by the interim 
constituents, which explicitly capture the impact of corporate events.  
DEFINITIONS  
Index Divisor (t)  
The index divisor for a day t is defined as the ratio of the initial market capitalization 
and the previous index level.  
IndexDivisor t=IndexInitialMarketCap t
IndexLevel t-1 
The index divisor does not change unless the index composition changes, e.g., in 
cases of corporate events and index additions / deletions where a change in index 
market capitalization is not due to performance and does not correspond to a 
change in the in dex level.  
The index divisor for day t is known after the close of day t-1 (the initial index market 
capitalization is calculated using prices and exchange rates as of day t-1 but 
constituents as of t). 
The index divisor can be calculated in any currency: both the index initial market 
capitalization and the previous index level need to be expressed in that currency.  
 
 Index Unit  
The index unit describes the set of index constituents and corresponding quantities 
of total value equal to the index level. It can be derived by dividing the total index 
quantities by the index divisor.  
 
Intraday Index Number of Shares (t)  
The intraday index number of shares is the number of shares of a security taken into 
account for the index calculation and valid both intraday and at the close of day t 
(before any changes due to corporate events or index reviews). Note that it is 
adjusted  by the various index inclusion factors, such as the Foreign Inclusion Factor 
(FIF)7, for day t. Also, note that it can be different from the number of shares used for 
the index calculation described in Section 1.1 (which is an end of day number of 
shares) in cases of corporate events.  
 
Intraday Index Unit Number of Shares (t)  
The intraday index unit number of shares is the intraday index number of shares 
expressed for one index unit. It is defined as the ratio of the intraday index number of 
shares and the index divisor.  
 
IntradayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares t=IntradayIndexNumberOfS hares t
IndexDivisor t 
 
End of Day Index Number of Shares (t)  
The end of day index number of shares is the number of shares of a security taken 
into account for the index calculation  for the next day (t+1) but expressed on a pre 
t+1 events basis (for example, if a company has a stock split on t+1, the end of day 
index number of shares for day t will be on a pre -split basis). This number of shares, 
however, takes into account changes d ue to corporate events effective as of the 
close of t and is adjusted by the various index inclusion factors such as the Foreign 
Inclusi on Factor (FIF) for day t+1. Note that it is based on the same number of shares 
as the one used for the index calculation on t+1 (EndOfDayIndexNumberOfShares t) 
and described in Section 1.1.  
 
7 Index inclusion factors encompass any inclusion factors specific to a given index, for example, the Value 
Inclusion Factor (VIF) for a Value index.  
 End of Day Index Unit Number of Shares (t)  
The end of day index unit number of shares is the end of day index number of shares 
expressed for one index unit. It is defined as the ratio of the end of day index number 
of shares and the index divisor for t+1.  
 
EndOfDayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares t=EndOfDayIndexNumberOfS hares t
IndexDivisor t+1 
 
The index unit composition changes from the intraday index unit number of shares to 
the end of day index unit number of shares as of the close of day t, i.e., the index unit 
number of shares change is calculated as  
 
IndexUnitNumberOfS haresC hange t=
EndOfDayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares t-IntradayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares t 
 
Index Dividend Points  
Index dividend points express dividends paid in an index unit for a given day. They 
represent dividends as a fraction of the index level itself. To provide advance notice, 
MSCI calculates both the preliminary index dividend points on t-1 for t that use 
exchange rates as of t-1 and the final index dividend points on t using t exchange 
rates and capturing the effect of  the intraday dividend changes on t, if any.  
Both gross and net index dividend points can be calculated for a price index variant: 
they express the amount of dividends paid by a price index unit.  
Net (gross) index dividend points can be calculated for a net (gross) index variant: 
they express the amount of dividends reinvested in the net (gross) index unit.  
 
PrelimDividendPoints t=DTRIndexNumberOfS hares *DividendPerS hare t/FXrate t-1
IndexDivisor t 
 
FinalDividendPoints t=DTRIndexNumberOfS hares *DividendPerS hare t/FXrate t
IndexDivisor t 
 
 Dividend points can be aggregated at index level.  
 
IndexPrelimDividendPoints t=PrelimDivdendPoints t 
IndexFinalDividendPoints t=FinalDivdendPoints t 
 
Pre-open Price  
The pre -open price of a security on day t is its closing price of day t-1 theoretically 
adjusted for the effects of corporate events affecting the security ex on day t. 
CALCULATING THE INDEX  
Index Calculation Formula  
The index unit value serves to calculate the index level. The equation below is valid 
both intraday and as of the close.  
 
IndexLevel t=IntradayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares i,t*Price i,t/FXrate i,t
iI 
where Price i,t is replaced by the pre -open price for the constituents that have not yet 
traded on t and I is the index unit constituent set. The previous index level can also 
be recalculated by using pre -open prices and exchange rates of the previous day.  
 
IndexLevel t-1=IntradayIndexUnitNumberOfS hares i,t*PreOpenPrice i,t/FXrate i,t-1
iI 
 
Index Calculation Example  
Consider the MSCI Austria index unit on October 27, 2009 described below. Its 
composition is fully known after the close of October 26, 2009 and is described by 
the constituent list and the intraday index unit number of shares (column F) 
calculated as the ratio of the intraday index number of shares and the index divisor.  
To calculate the index level on October 27, 2009 (intraday or close), current prices 
and exchange rates (columns I and J respectively) are used for each constituent, and 
the market capitalization of the constituent in the index unit (column K) is obtained 
by multiplying the intraday index unit NOS by the prices and dividing by the exchange 
rate. The sum of the column K gives the value of the index unit, which is equal to the 
index level.  
  
 
CALCULATING INDEX UNIT CHANGES DUE TO CORPORATE EVENTS AND 
INDEX REBALANCINGS  
As corporate events and rebalancings occur, the index unit composition can change. 
All adjustments are based on closing prices. To get the index unit adjustment, the 
new index divisor needs to be calculated. Dividing the end of day index number of 
shares b y the new index divisor results in the end of day index unit number of shares. 
Given the equations  
 
IndexDivisor t+1=IndexInitialMarketCap t+1
IndexLevel t (coming from the divisor definition), and  
IndexDivisor t=IndexAdjustedMarketCap t
IndexLevel t (coming from  the divisor definition  and the 
fact the index level is proportional to the index market capitalization on any given 
day), a practical way of calculating the new divisor is  
 
IndexDivisor t+1=IndexDivisor t*IndexInitialMarketCap t+1
IndexAdjustedMarketCap t

 be added to the index. Hence, the index divisor and the index unit composition will 
change as of the close of October 21, 2009.  
A new index divisor (for October 22, 2009) is calculated by multiplying the current 
divisor (for October 21, 2009) by the sum of the next day constituents' initial market 
capitalizations (column M) and dividing by the current index market capitalization 
(sum of column L). The new end of day index unit number of shares (column N) is 
calculated by dividing the end of day index number of shares (column H) by the new 
divisor. The index unit composition is adjusted by the difference between the end of 
day index unit number of shares and intraday index unit number of shares (column 
O): in this case, 0.16 shares of BC SANTANDER BRASIL UNIT are added to the index 
unit by decreasing the index unit number of shares of all the other index constituents.  
 
 
INTERIM CONSTITUENTS8 
On days with certain corporate events, the index can hold constituents that influence 
the performance for a day. When calculating  the index performance using price 
adjustment factors (as described in section 1.1), these do not appear explicitly in the 
calculation formula but are accounted for implicitly by applying a price adjustment 
factor (PAF) on the capitalization of the securit y affected by the corporate event. The 
index, however, is exposed to all the constituents and when valuing an index unit, 
these  need to be explicitly taken into account. For example, the following corporate 
events result in a creation of interim constituents:

product (delivered at the end of 2010).

 Capital Repayments : the index calculation assumes that cash is received in the index 
and held until the close when it is finally reinvested in the index so cash effectively 
brings performance to the index on the ex -date and is part of the index unit  
Spin -off with the spun -off company not eligible for the index : the calculation 
assumes that the spun -off company is received in the index on the ex -date and is 
held until the close when it is finally sold and the proceeds reinvested back in the 
index. In this case, the spun -off company is effectively part of the ind ex on the ex -
date  
 
Note that the interim constituents play a similar role in the index calculation as the 
price adjustment factor (PAF) and the resulting index levels are exactly the same 
whether using interim constituents or PAFs.  
To explain how interim constituents are created, several examples of common 
corporate events are described below. Some corporate events can result in the 
creation of more than one interim constituent, but these can also be broken up in 
several simple conse cutive corporate events.  
 
Examples  
Capital Repayment  
As an example, consider the repayment of EUR 0.4 per share by ELISA A effective 
October 26, 2009. According to the calculation methodology, this cash is reinvested 
back in the index as of the close of the ex date, October 26, 2009. Hence, intraday, 
the MSC I Finland index unit holds both ELISA A and the cash. An interim constituent 
is therefore added to the index unit, as shown below, with the following 
characteristics:  
Intraday index unit number of shares equal to the stock that repaid capital (given that 
each share of ELISA A in the index unit is entitled to the cash payment)  
Fixed price equals to the repayment amount, EUR 0.40.  
Cash will leave the index unit as of the close of October 26 (as indicated by column 
G) and the proceeds reinvested back in the index. Repeating the calculations 
described in the previous section gives the index unit number of shares change 
(column O) that  represents the theoretical trade adjustment to the index unit: cash is 
"sold" (negative change) while the index unit holdings in all the other constituents 
increase (positive change)  
  
 
Spin -off with the Spun -off Company Traded on the Ex date  
As an example, consider the spin -off of GAM HOLDING by JULIUS BAER HOLDING 
with 1:1 terms effective October 1, 2009 for the MSCI Switzerland Large Cap index 
(displayed below). The spun -off company is not eligible to stay in the index.  
On the ex date (October 1, 2009), the spun -off company still brings performance to 
the index and is hence part of the index unit. It is therefore part of the index with the 
following characteristics:  
Intraday index unit number of shares calculated according to the terms (intraday 
index unit number of shares of the parent stock * 1/1)  
Market price given that the spun -off company is traded on the ex-date.  
It is "sold" from the MSCI Switzerland Large Cap index unit at the close of the ex -date 
and the proceeds are reinvested back in the index. To determine the index unit 
number of shares (column O), the calculations described in the previous section 
should be  repeated.

Spin -off with Spun -off Not Traded on the Ex date  
As an example, consider the spinoff of SONAE CAPITAL by SONAE SGPS effective 
January 4, 2008. Given that the spun -off company is not trading on the ex -date but 
the market capitalization of the parent stock drops nevertheless to account for the 
value of the  spun -off company, MSCI creates a "dummy" security called "detached" 
to represent it. Its price is calculated as the difference between the cum and ex 
prices of the parent security on the ex -date from the ex -date + 1 onwards. It will be 
carried in the inde x at this calculated fixed price until the day it starts trading where it 
is either added to the index or deleted at the end of the first trading day. On the ex -
date, however, it is represented by an interim constituent with the following 
characteristics:  
Intraday index unit number of shares equal to the parent company (terms are not 
considered as this is a "dummy" security  
Calculated price in real time equal to the difference between the cum price (closing 
price of the previous day) of the parent company and the ex (current) price  
At the close of the ex -date, the interim constituent is replaced by the detached 
security. Note that there is no divisor change and hence no index unit number of 
shares change.

Rights Issue  
As an example, consider the rights issue for BALFOUR BEATTY effective October 8, 
2009 in the MSCI UK Index9 and described below. 3 rights were offered for every 7 
shares held at 1.8 GBP.  
The performance of the index on the ex -date reflects an exposure to the rights and 
the BALFOUR BEATTY weight increases only as of the close of the ex -date. Note that 
the adjustment for a rights issue is always theoretical (the intrinsic value of the right 
is the difference between the underlying stock price and the subscription price), even 
if the rights will list on an exchange.  An interim constituent with the following 
characteristics is created:  
Intraday index unit number of shares calculated according to the terms (intraday 
index unit number of shares of BALFOUR BEATTY times 3/7)  
A calculated price defined as the price of BALFOUR BEATTY minus the subscription 
price of 1.8  
At the end of the day, the interim constituent is deleted from the index (the rights are 
subscribed to) and the exposure to BALFOUR BEATTY increases (its intraday index 
number of shares and the divisor increase). The index unit adjustment (column O) is 
given by the calculations described in the previous sections.  
 
 
9 Note that this example is based on the current adjustment methodology for rights issue. The methodology 
being different before November 2009, the published index level was calculated in a different way in practice

Multiple corporate events happening on the same day use a combination of the above rules and can potentially result in severa l interim 
constituents being created  
*In case of multiple  corporate events, the field "EndOfDayNOS(t -1)" should be replaced by the "IntradayNOS" calculated during the previous 
event
 AUGUST 2024  INDEX METHODOLOGY   
Appendix XI: Index Correction Policy  
If the impact of an error is below 50 basis points on the country index OR on the 
World/EM Industry Group (or 50 basis points on the MSCI Frontier Markets region 
including the MSCI GCC Countries),  no index re statement is made.  
If the impact of the error is greater or equal to 50 basis points on the country index 
OR on the World/EM Industry Group (or 50 basis points on the MSCI Frontier Markets 
region including the MSCI GCC Countries), all of the indexes affected by 50 basis 
poin ts or more  are re stated.   
In certain circumstances, such as errors in the list of constituents (i.e. a security 
missed), or if MSCI finds that  the error is significant enough to justify the revision of 
indexes impacted by less than 50 basis point (e.g.  1/3 of US prices wrong), MS CI 
reserves the right to correct information even if the impact is lower than the 50 basis 
points correction threshold.  
MSCI applies a 12 months correction period. Errors on historical values older than 12 
months are in general not revised.  
  
 Appendix XII: Sunday -Thursday Index Calculation 
Methodology  
Calculation Methodology  
MSCI also provides a different series of indexes, that are calculated from Sunday to 
Thursday and which reflect the performances of markets that follow a Sunday to 
Thursday trading calendar. These Indexes are not calculated on Friday or Saturday.  
The Sunday index performances capture the price changes and reflect corporate 
events effective on this day.  In case of corporate events occurring on Sundays and 
where a Price Adjustment Factor (PAF) is needed, the PAF is applied to the market 
price of the security on Sunday.  
Changes in the security's number of shares, FIFs and/or DIFs , Additions/deletions to 
and from Index  due to corporate events are implemented as of the close of Sunday, 
regardless of whether the corporate event requires the application of a PAF or not.  
The index constituent list is calculated from Sunday to Thursday.  
MSCI carries forward  the WM/Refinitiv  spot FX rates as of the previous Friday  for the 
index calculation  on Sunday . 
Dividends are reinvested on Sundays. Consequently, the Daily Total Return (DTR) 
index performances for Sunday will be calculated by comparing DTR Index levels of 
the previous Thursday.  
 
The chain -linking for these indexes can be summarized as follows:  
* Sunday's daily index performance is computed by comparing Sunday's adjusted 
prices and the previous Thursday's unadjusted prices  
* Monday's daily index performance is computed by comparing Monday's adjusted 
prices and the Previous Sunday's unadjusted prices.

Where:  
* InclusionFactorSunday  is the inclusion factor of the security as of Sunday. The inclusion 
factor can be one or the combination of the following factors: Foreign Inclusion Factor, 
Domestic Inclusion Factor, Growth Inclusion Factor, Value Inclusion Factor, Index 
Inclusion Factor  (*). 
 
The Security Full Market Caps are calculated as follows:

Where:  
* EndOfDayNumberOfS haresThursday is the number of shares of security(s) as of the 
end of the previous Thursday.  
* PricePerS hareSunday  is the price per share of the security(s) as of Sunday.  
* PricePerS hareThursday  is the price per share of security(s) as of the previous Thursday.  
* PAFSunday  is the Price Adjustment Factor of the security(s) as of Sunday.  
* FXrateSunday  is the FX rate of the price currency of security(s) vs USD as of Sunday. It is 
the value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
* FXrateThursday  is the FX rate of the price currency of security(s) vs USD as of the 
previous Thursday. It is the value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
* ICISunday  is the Internal Currency Index of price currency as of Sunday. The ICI is 
different than 1 when a country changes the internal value of its currency (e.g. from 
Turkish Lira to New Turkish Lira - ICI = 1,000,000).  
* ICIThursday  is the Internal Currency Index of price currency as of previous Thursday.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Appendix X III: Advance Notification in Index 
Calculation  
MSCI indexes undergo index reviews with a scheduled frequency  and pro forma 
index information is announced in advance of the effective date of the review. The 
schedule of index reviews and the number of days for advance notification are as 
mentioned in the corresponding index methodology books. To enable such an 
advance n otification, the index reviews are conducted in advance of the effective 
date based on pro forma index information, consistent with the advance notification 
requirement. This advance notifi cation does not exist in the calculation of index 
history, and in other situations when simulated index data is used, where  all indexes 
are calculated based on index data as o f the effective date.

Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates i ndexes, but does not manage 
actual assets. The calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. In dex returns do not reflect payment of any sales 
charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments. The impositi on of these fees and
