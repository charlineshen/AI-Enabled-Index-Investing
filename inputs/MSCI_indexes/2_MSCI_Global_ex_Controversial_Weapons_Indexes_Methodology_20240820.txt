1. Introduction  
The MSCI Global ex Controversial Weapons Indexes (the 'Indexes') have been developed for use by 
investors, including pension funds, and universal owners who wish to avoid investments in cluster 
bombs, landmines, depleted uranium, chemical and biological we apons, blinding laser weapons, 
non-detectable fragments and incendiary weapons (white phosphorus).  
These indexes are free float - adjusted market capitalization weighted .1   
 
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents ("Methodology Set"), including the present index 
methodology document. Please refer to Appendix II for more details   
2. Constructing the Indexes  
The Indexes use company ratings and research provided by MSCI ESG Research2 for the Index 
construction.  
2.1 Underlying Universe  
The selection universe for the Indexes is defined by the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable 
Market Indexes (GIMI).  
2.2 Eligibility Criteria  
Companies that meet the business involvement criteria are excluded from the Indexes. Please refer 
to Appendix I for details on these criteria.  
* Cluster Bombs  
* Landmines  
* Depleted Uranium Weapons  
* Chemical and Biological Weapons  
* Blinding Laser Weapons  
* Non-Detectable Fragments  
* Incendiary Weapons (White Phosphorus)  
 
2.3 Treatment of Unrated Companies  
Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening 
Research data are not eligible for inclusion in the Indexes if they are classified in the following Global 
Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))3 Industry Groups: Capital Goods  and Materials . 
  
 
2 See section 4 for further information regarding ESG and climate data used in the Indexes that MSCI Limited and MSCI Deutschla nd 
GmbH source from MSCI ESG Research LLC, a separate subsidiary of MSCI Inc. MSCI ESG Research is solely responsible for the 
creat ion, determination and management of such data as a provider to MSCI Limited and MSCI Deutschland GmbH. MSCI Limited 
and MSCI Deutschland GmbH are the benchmark administrators for the MSCI indexes.  
3 GICS  is the global industry classification standard jointly developed by MSCI and S&P Global Market Intelligence.  
3. Maintaining the Indexes  
3.1 Index Reviews  
The Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the Index Reviews of the MSCI Global 
Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business day of 
February, May, August and November. At index reviews, all  companies in the underlying universe are 
reviewed and eligible companies are added to the Indexes. Existing constituents may be deleted 
from the Indexes if they become involved in controversial weapons and are screened according to 
the criteria described in Section 3. Any constituent that is deleted from the Parent index as a result 
of an index review is also deleted from the Indexes.  
 
The pro forma Indexes are generally announced nine business days before the effective date.  
 
In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data3 (MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening 
Research) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the MSCI 
Global ex Controversial Weapons Indexes. For some securities, such data may not be published by 
MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI 
will use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of the 
Indexes . 
 
3.2 Ongoing Event-Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes.  
No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. 
Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously.  
There are no deletions from the Index between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
involved in controversial weapons.  
 
EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will not be added to the Index 
at the time of event implementation. Such securities 
will be considered for addition in the Index at  the 
subsequent Index Review . 
  
Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Index at the time of event implementation. 
Reevaluation for addition in the Index will occur at the 
subsequent Index Review.  
 
3 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes.  
 
 
Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index.  
 
Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.). Reevaluation for continued 
inclusion in the Index will occur at the subsequent 
Index Review.  
 
Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events relevant to this Index
