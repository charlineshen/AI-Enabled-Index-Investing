 Section 1: Introduction  
In 1999, the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) was developed by MSCI in collaboration 
with S&P Dow Jones Indices to provide an efficient, detailed and flexible tool for use in the 
investment process. It is designed to respond to the global financial community's need for a global, 
accurate, complete and widely accepted approach  to defining industries and classifying securities 
by industry. Its universal approach to industry classification aims to improve transparency and 
efficiency in the investment process.  
The key features of the GICS Structure are that it is:  
* Universal: the Structure applies to companies  globally.  
* Reliable: the Structure correctly reflects the current state of industries in the equity 
investment  universe.  
* Flexible: the Structure offers four levels of analysis, ranging from the most general Sector to the 
most specialized  Sub-Industry.  
* Evolving: Annual Reviews are conducted by MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices  to ensure that the 
Structure remains fully representative of today's global  markets.  
* The GICS Structure presented in this document is the latest Structure post our recent major 
reviews that included the creation of a new Sector for Real Estate that was carved out from the 
Financials Sector and transformation of the Telecommunication Servic es Sector as the 
Communication Services Sector.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
1.1 Overview of GICS  
To provide the level of precision critical in the investment process, the GICS is designed with four 
levels of classifications that includes 11 Sectors, 2 5 Industry Groups, 74 Industries, and 1 63 Sub-
Industries.  
The GICS has 11 Sector classifications:  
* Energy  
* Materials  
* Industrials  
* Consumer Discretionary  
* Consumer Staples  
* Health Care  
* Financials  
* Information Technology  
* Communication Services  
* Utilities  
* Real Estate  
 
GICS classifications can be presented in either text or numeric formats. The complete GICS 
classification for each company is an 8 -digit code with text description. The hierarchical design of 
the 8 -digit coding system allows for easy transition between GIC S tiers.  
 
Definitions of GICS Sub -Industries are provided in Section 7.

 1.3 Philosophy and objectives of GICS  
The way in which securities are classified into asset classes forms the basis of many important 
investment decisions. The relative merits of each security are judged primarily within these asset 
classes, and investment decisions are taken within this frame work.  
 
APPROACHES TO INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES  
Grouping companies based on industries is not a relatively straightforward task as multiple factors 
need to be evaluated in determining the classification that aptly reflects the business model of the 
company as well as adds value to the investment process . There are many approaches to developing 
industry classification schemes, some of which are discussed below.  
At one extreme is the purely statistical approach, which is solely financial market - based and backward 
looking, using past returns. Aggregations are formed around correlation, often yielding non -intuitive 
groupings that are dissimilar across countries and  regions. Another approach attempts to define a 
priori financial market -oriented groups or themes, such as cyclical, interest rate sensitive, etc. The 
difficulty, however, lies in finding widely accepted and relatively stable definitions for these themes.  
Two other approaches begin with an economic perspective on companies. The first focuses on a 
production orientation while the other adopts a market or demand orientation in company analysis. 
The production -oriented approach was effective in the past in its  analysis of the microstructure of 
industries from the producers' standpoint. For instance, it segregated goods and services on the 
premise that it was a different set of companies that provided each to consumers. As the structure of 
the global economy evo lved, limitations of this approach became increasingly obvious. The ever -
increasing share of discretionary income brought about by economic development, emergence of the 
service era, and the availability and accessibility of information with the advent of new communication 
technology has moved the emphasis from producers to consumers.  
 
THE GICS: MARKET DEMAND -ORIENTED  
The Global Industry Classification Standard is designed to be market demand - oriented in its 
analysis and classification of companies. For example, drawing the line between goods and services 
is becoming increasingly arbitrary as they are now commonly sold together. This distinction between 
goods and services is replaced by adopting the more market -oriented Sectors of "Consumer 
Discretionary" and "Consumer Staples", which group goods and services Sub-Industries.  
In addition, the creation of large stand -alone Sectors such as Health Care, Information Technology 
and Communication Services accurately represents industries that provide significant value to the 
consumer in today's global and integrated economy. This fur ther contributes to a more uniform 
distribution of weights among the 11 GICS Sectors.  
  
 Section 2: Companies Eligible for G ICS Classification  
Companies that have issued equity securities are eligible for a GICS classification.  
If a company's subsidiary files separate financials to its reporting government agency, that 
subsidiary is considered a separate entity and classified independently under the GICS Methodology.  
GICS is not assigned to supranationals, municipals, sovereigns, shell companies, mutual funds, or 
exchange traded funds.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Section 3: Guidelines for GICS Classification  
The GICS is strictly hierarchical and thus a company can only belong to one grouping at each of the 
four levels.  
 
3.1 Classification  by revenue  and earnings  
In order to provide an accurate, complete and long -term view of the global investment universe, 
a company's revenues often provide a more stable and precise reflection of its activities than 
earnings. Furthermore, industrial and geographical breakdowns of revenues are more 
commonly available than earnings broken down the same way for most companies. 
Nevertheless, company valuations are more closely related to earnings than revenues. 
Therefore, earnings remain an important secondary consideration in a compan y's Industry 
Classification. In addition to revenue and earnings, market perception is also recognized as 
relevant for classification purposes.  
As a general rule, a company is classified in the Sub -Industry whose definition most closely 
describes the business activities that generate more than 60% of the company's revenues.  
Example: Amazon.com, Inc.  
 
2022 fiscal year  Sales  
Online stores (Broadline Retail)  43%  
Physical stores (Broadline Retail)  4% 
Third -party seller services (Broadline Retail)  23%  
Subscription services  7% 
Advertising services  7% 
Amazon Web Services (AWS)  16%  
Other  1% 
Total  100%

Industry Group  2550  Consumer Discretionary Distribution & Retail  
Industry  255030  Broadline Retail  
Sub-Industry  25503030  Broadline Retail  
 
However, a company engaged in two or more substantially different business activities, none of 
which contribute 60% or more of revenues, is classified in the Sub - Industry that provides the 
majority of both the company's revenues and earnings.

 GLOBAL INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION STANDARD (GICS(r)) METHODOLOGY  
AUGUST 2024  
 
When no Sub -Industry provides the majority of both the company's revenues and earnings, the 
classification will be determined based on further research and analysis.  
In addition, a company significantly diversified across three or more Sectors, none of which 
contributes the majority of revenues or earnings, is classified either in the Industrial Conglomerates 
Sub-Industry (Industrial Sector) or in the Multi -Sector Hold ings Sub -Industry (Financials Sector).  
Example: General Electric (US)  
 
2022 fiscal year  Revenue  Profit/Loss  
Aerospace  33%  74%  
Renewable Energy  17%  -35%  
Power  21%  19%  
HealthCare  24%  42%  
Corporate  5% - 
Total  100%  100%

Industry Group  2010  Capital Goods  
Industry  201050  Industrial Conglomerates  
Sub-Industry  20105010  Industrial Conglomerates  
 
3.2 Propagation of GICS from company level to security level  
GICS is assigned at the company level. Thus, all equity securities including ADRs and GDRs issued 
by a company have the same classification as the company.  
A tracking stock issued by a parent company is classified based on its underlying business . 
 
3.3 Source of information used for GICS classification  
The primary source of information used for classification is a company's annual reports and 
accounts. Other sources include broker reports and other published research literature. In the case 
of a new issue, the classification will be based primarily on th e description of the company's 
activities and pro forma results as given in the prospectus.

Section 4: Review of GICS Classification  
A company's Sub -Industry classification will be reviewed either when a significant corporate 
restructuring occurs or when a new annual report is available. GICS reviews also occur upon client 
request.  
In order to provide a stable Sub -Industry classification, when reviewing a company's classification, 
changes will be minimized in the Sub -Industry classification to the extent possible by disregarding 
temporary fluctuations in the results of a company's di fferent activities.

Section 5: GICS Structure Review  
MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices are committed to ensuring that the GICS Structure remains 
relevant and up -to-date. This is accomplished through an Annual Review of the Structure. This 
Review includes a detailed internal analysis to develop a proposal for po tential structural changes 
and public request for comments and in -depth client consultations with various market participants 
as a means of obtaining feedback on proposed structural changes.  
Further information on changes to the GICS Structure can be found on MSCI's website at

*A company will be classified as a REIT, if it mentions in an official document that it operates as a 
REIT (as per the country's effective legal REIT structure). In general, to be classified as a REIT, a 
company must have a Property Trust Structure (either as a stand -alone trust or stapled), with 
primary investments in real estate or mortgage loans and where majority of the company's taxable 
Income is paid out as a dividend. If stapled, it should derive at least 60% of revenue from the trust 
arm. Asset hold ings break down and net earnings are also considered while determining the GICS 
classification, in general.

AUGUST 2024  
 
Section 8: MSCI Fixed Income Sector Classification Guidelines  
MSCI also leverages the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) to classify companies that 
have issued Fixed Income securities such as corporate bonds.  
 
8.1 Fixed income universe eligible for classification  
Corporates that have issued bonds are eligible for a classification.  
Supranationals, Municipals and Sovereigns that have issued fixed income securities are currently not 
covered under this Methodology.  
 
8.1.1 Classification of a company that has issued both equity and 
corporate bonds  
Propagation of GICS from company level to security level  
GICS is assigned at the company level and thus all securities, equities or corporate bonds, 
issued by the company will have the same GICS classification as the company.  
MSCI leverages GICS assigned to a company that has issued equity securities and assigns 
the same GICS classification to the corporate bonds issued by the company.  
 
Example: GICS of a corporate bond issued by General Electric  
The corporate bond issued by General Electric will have the same GICS as assigned to 
General Electric.  
GICS level  GICS code  GICS description  
Sector  20 Industrials  
Industry Group  2010  Capital Goods  
Industry  201050  Industrial Conglomerates  
Sub-Industry  20105010  Industrial Conglomerates

 GLOBAL INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION STANDARD (GICS(r)) METHODOLOGY  
AUGUST 2024  
 
8.1.2 Classification of a company that has issued only corporate bonds  
Each corporate bond issuer is assigned to a GICS Sub -Industry based on the GICS of its 
related listed entity, i.e., its parent company or ultimate parent company, as available in GICS 
Direct.  
 
Example: GICS of corporate bond issued by Coca -Cola Refreshments USA Inc.  
Coca -Cola Refreshments USA Inc.'s parent is Coca -Cola Co which is classified as "30201030 
- Soft Drinks".  
GICS of the corporate bond issued by Coca -Cola Refreshments USA Inc. will be:  
 
GICS level  GICS code  GICS description  
Sector  30 Consumer Staples  
Industry Group  3020  Food, Beverage and Tobacco  
Industry  302010  Beverages  
Sub-Industry  30201030  Soft Drinks  & Non -alcoholic Beverages  
 
In cases where the related entities, i.e., its parent and ultimate parent company don't have 
GICS in GICS Direct, the corporate bond issuer will be classified based on its own or its 
related entities' underlying business using the GICS framework.  
 
In addition, if the corporate bond issuer is a special purpose vehicle or a captive finance 
vehicle, it will be classified based on the business of its related entities as described in 
Section 3.

 GLOBAL INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION STANDARD (GICS(r)) METHODOLOGY  
AUGUST 2024  
 
8.2 Source of information used for the GICS classification of  
fixed income  
The primary source of information used to classify fixed income securities is the company's annual 
reports and accounts. Other sources include broker reports and other published research literature. 
In the case of a new issue, the classification will be de termined based primarily on the description of 
the company's activities and pro forma results as given in the prospectus.  
 
8.3 Maintenance of GICS for companies that have issued 
corporate bonds  
8.3.1 Ongoing review  
A company's Sub -Industry classification will be reviewed at least annually. It will also be 
reviewed when a significant corporate restructuring occurs. GICS reviews could also occur 
upon client request.  
In order to provide a stable Sub -Industry classification, when reviewing a company's 
classification, changes will be minimized in the Sub -Industry classification to the extent 
possible by disregarding temporary fluctuations in the results of a company's di fferent 
activities.  
 
8.3.2 Impact of GICS structure review  
All changes in the GICS Structure and definitions resulting from a Structure Review will be 
applicable to the classification of companies that have issued fixed income securities as well.

* Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates i ndexes, but does

payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Inve stments. The 
imposition of these fees and charges would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investm ent to be different than the MSCI index performance.

material differences between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strat egy.
