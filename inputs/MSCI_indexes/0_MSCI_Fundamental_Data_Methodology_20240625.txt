 INTRODUCTION  
MSCI began publishing annual fundamental data for developed market companies in 1969 and 
for emerging market companies in 1988. MSCI has accumulated a large volume of historical 
fundamental data during this period.

MSCI uses these fundamental data items to define:  
* Fundamental per share data  
* Security ratios  
* Index ratios  
* Balance Sheet information  
 In addition, MSCI uses fundamental data to calculate the variables used to assign style to 
securities under its Value and Growth methodology. The following table summarizes the key 
variables calculated by MSCI using fundamental data:

For certain corporate events MSCI may also adjust and/or restate fundamental data and related 
ratios in order to maintain comparability between historical and future data. These adjustments 
are made based on the timing of the event and availability of information at the time of the 
event.  
 Depending on the MSCI Equity Index Series or the Global Equity Model, MSCI will provide 
different fundamental data for each product on a monthly basis. Per share data and security 
ratios (price to sales, price to earnings, return on equity, price to cash e arnings, price to book 
value, dividend yield) are provided for all MSCI Equity Index Series and Global Equity Models. 
Fundamental data used for style attribution is distributed for the MSCI Value and Growth 
Indexes and the Global Equity Models. This data i ncludes long -term historical growth trends, 
current internal growth rate, and forecasted earnings figures.  
MSCI strives to maintain clear and transparent rules that best reflect the accounting standards 
of each country in a consistent manner. The information provided in this methodology book 
relates to all equity index products distributed by MSCI that use fund amental data.  The book 
demonstrates MSCI's use of fundamental data to calculate financial ratios and indicators at 
both the security and index level.  Additionally, this book demonstrates how MSCI uses 
fundamental data in connection with corporate events.  
 1 FUNDAMENTAL PER SHARE DATA  
MSCI provides per share data on an annualized basis and calculates the data on a company 
level in which all classes (listed and unlisted) of equity are aggregated. The total shares 
outstanding for the latest period is used for per share data calculations.  
MSCI provides two types of fundamental per share data:  
* Historical  
* Forecasted  
Using historical and forecasted data, MSCI calculates security and index ratios. The following 
section details how MSCI gathers and calculates all fundamental per share data.  
1.1 GENERAL RULES  
1.1.1  NUMBER OF SHARES  
To calculate per share figures, MSCI uses the total number of shares at the company level at 
the date of the results.  
All of the company's share classes, listed and unlisted, are aggregated in the total number of 
shares regardless of whether they are included in an index, as long as they exhibit 
characteristics of equity securities and are eligible for the MSCI universe. If preferred shares 
exhibit equity -like charact eristics, they are included in the number of shares for per share 
calculation  
MSCI always excludes stock options, warrants and convertible securities from the number of 
shares outstanding. In other words, diluted number of shares is not used. In general, treasury 
shares are systematically excluded from index level calculations and f rom number of shares 
used for per share calculations.  
Total number of shares at the company level at the date of the results is used to calculate per 
share figures, except United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland where 
average number of shares is used for per share calculations of earn ings, cash earnings, and 
sales as is the standard practice in these countries.  
For companies where MSCI tracks their Depository Receipts (ADR, GDR) or Certificates of 
Participation (CPO), MSCI reports the fundamental per -share variables on a 'per -ADR / GDR' or 
'per-CPO' basis.  
1.1.2  CONSOLIDATION  
MSCI always calculates fundamental data using consolidated information unless consolidated 
results are unavailable or are not reported on a regular basis. However, in countries like India, 
 owing to the disclosure procedures, there could be use of unconsolidated data for interim 
financial results whereas the fiscal period financial results could be consolidated.  
1.1.3  CURRENCY AND FREQUENCY  
MSCI reports fundamental data in the currency of a company's country of classification based 
on GIMI Method ology.  In general, MSCI follows the frequency of the company reporting.  For 
example, if companies report quarterly results, MSCI also follows quarterly results.  
1.1.4  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS USED  
The primary accounting standard followed by MSCI is the local GAAP. If the company does not 
report in local GAAP but reports in other GAAPs, such as IAS or US GAAP, then MSCI will follow 
the latter. For a large number of European countries and some other c ountries in the Asia -
Pacific, MSCI started following IFRS accounting in the year 2006 (please refer to Appendix I for 
details on MSCI's treatment of some specific issues related to IFRS).  
1.1.5  SOURCES AND UPDATES  
MSCI sources company information from third party vendors as well as from publicly available 
information made available by the companies. In addition, MSCI reflects publicly available 
information once it is available in the market, provided that the inform ation is complete. We 
commonly obtain information in the form of vendor files, press releases, interim and annual 
reports. MSCI uses both audited and unaudited reports.  
MSCI endeavors to ensure correctness, quality and timeliness of data loaded into its database, 
by employing quality control procedures like updating company information only upon 
availability of complete information, such as official filings with stock exc hanges or regulators 
or upon dual vendor validation. Emphasis is placed on updating the results of bigger companies 
first, but without undue delay for updating the results for all companies.   
 
 
1.2 HISTORICAL PER SHARE DATA CALCULATIONS1 
The following are the historical per share figures that are reported and/or used by MSCI:  
 
1 MSCI will update Fundamental per share data for China A "Stock Connect" listings based on the offshore RMB exchange 
rate (CNH). In addition, for securities listed outside China and reporting their financials in RMB, MSCI will publish fundame ntal 
per share data based  on CNH effective March 2018 month -end.  
 
 * Sales per share (SPS)  
* Earnings per share (EPS)  
* Cash earnings per share (CEPS)  
* Dividends per share (DPS)  
* Book value per share (BVPS)  
 
In general, historical per share figures are calculated using the following formula:  
Per share figure =Trailing  12-mont h figure
Number  of shares  outstanding  at a company  level 
Trailing 12-mont hfigure =Last  reported  fiscal  period  figure +(Current  interim  figure -
Comparative  interim  figure )  
 
For instance, if the last period for which results are reported is for an interim period of 3 months 
ended Mar 31, 2011, the trailing 12 -month Earnings will be calculated as:  
Trailing 12 -month earnings = Fiscal period earnings for the year ended Dec 31, 2010 + (3 month 
earnings for the current interim period ended Mar 31, 2011 - 3 month earnings for the 
comparative interim period ended Mar 31, 2010)  
The following are exceptions:  
* Dividends per share are always used on a per share basis as provided by the company for 
all calculations.  
* Book value per share is calculated using the latest reported book value; a trailing 12 -month 
figure is not calculated.  
MSCI calculates security per share and ratios if the gap between calculation date and financial 
reporting period end date is less than 18 months. For example, per share and ratios will not be 
calculated for a security reporting fundamental data as of perio d ended December 31, 2017 for 
June 30, 2019 calculation date.   
The following section defines the general rules for historical per share figures and their use.  
1.2.1  SALES PER SHARE (SPS)  
MSCI defines sales for all issuers as net operating revenues from all on -going lines of business 
of the company.  
Due to the different definitions of sales in different industries, MSCI applies cert ain exceptional 
treatment in sales reported for some companies :  
 * For Banks  (GICS(r) Industry Group 4010), MSCI does not publish sales.  
* For Insurance companies  (GICS(r) Industry Group 4030), MSCI uses the net premiums 
earned (or net premiums written, if the former is not available) as a proxy for sales.  
* For certain companies that report higher revenues on account of notional contracts or 
sales, MSCI may report revenues net of operating cost.  
MSCI follows cumulative sales reported by the companies, instead of quarterly sales figures. In 
addition, excise tax is always deducted from sales whenever this information is available.  
MSCI uses sales for two purposes:  
* Price/Sales , which is calculated using the trailing 12 -month sales per share figure; and  
* Long -term Historical SPS growth trend , which is calculated using the last five years fiscal 
year -end sales per share.  
1.2.2  EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)  
MSCI defines earnings as the net income from the continuing operations available to all equity 
shareholders (i.e., all shareholders holding securities that exhibit equity -like characteristics), 
excluding extraordinary items or non -recurring items, minority  interest and preferred dividends 
(in cases where preferred shares do not exhibit equity like characteristics).  
In cases where MSCI determines that a company has unusual gains or losses that do not reflect 
the earnings potential of the company going forward, the item will be treated as non -recurring 
and will be excluded from earnings on an after -tax basis.   
Generally, MSCI will adjust profit and losses to reflect normalized earnings in instances such as 
for profit / loss on sale of discontinued operations, restructuring charges, bankruptcy charges, 
changes in accounting policy , impairment losses, acquisition/merger related costs, litigation 
charges, gains or losses in disposal of assets, gains or losses in early extinguishment of debt, 
tax benefit or expense  on account of new tax legislation , etc.    
Additionally , for the below sectors , MSCI applies the following exceptional treatment on the 
extraordinary / non -recurring items : 
 
* Gains or losses due to revaluation of property belonging to  companies in the Real 
Estate Sector (GICS Sector 60), which can have a large impact on earnings are 
considered extraordinary / non -recurring item s (see Appendix I).  
* Impairment of oil & gas properties for companies in the Oil & Gas Industry Group (GICS 
Industry Group 1010) is considered part of normal operating expenses . Hence this is 
not considered as an extraordinary / non -recurring item . 
* Unrealized gains or losses on financial assets held by companies in the Insurance 
Industry  Group  (GICS Industry 4030) or the  Banks Industry Group (Industry Group 4010) 
 are part of normal operations.  Hence these are  not considered as extraordinary / non -
recurring item s. 
 
For all countries, the EPS is calculated using net earnings and number of shares, except in the 
US, Canada, the UK, and Ireland where MSCI follows basic (undiluted) EPS from continuing 
operations available to common shareholders as reported by companies.  
MSCI uses earnings per share for four purposes:  
* Price/Earnings , which is calculated using the trailing 12 -month earnings per share figure;  
* Long -term Historical EPS growth trend , which is calculated using the last five years fiscal 
year -end earnings per share;  
* Return on Equity (RO E), which is calculated using the trailing 12 -month earnings per share 
figure and latest book value per share; and  
* Current Internal Growth Rate (g) , which is calculated using return on equity and the dividend 
payout ratio.  
1.2.3  CASH EARNINGS PER SHARE (CEPS)  
MSCI defines cash earnings as earnings per share, as stated above, including depreciation and 
amortization as reported by the company. In cases where amortization is not reported, then 
only depreciation is added back to earnings in order to calculate cash earnings. In addition, 
where a company does not report depreciation and / or amortization values in its interim 
financial statements, the latest fiscal values will be used to compute CEPS.  
Due to the nature of business of Banks (GICS(r) Industry Group 4010) and Insurance companies 
(GICS(r) Industry Group 4030), MSCI does not publish cash earnings.  
MSCI uses cash earnings per share to calculate:  
Price/Cash Earnings , which is calculated using the trailing 12 -month cash earnings per share 
figure.  
1.2.4  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE (DPS)  
MSCI defines regular cash dividends as those paid from annual operating profits and/or 
accumulated earnings, while capital repayments or returns of capital are defined as cash 
distributions from the company's share capital or additional paid -in capital (ca pital contribution 
reserve). Regular capital repayments are considered as regular cash dividends.  
To estimate the current annualized dividend, MSCI takes the sum of all the declared regular 
cash distributions (dividends or capital repayments), including the ones not yet ex or paid, over 
the latest 12 -month period.  
 However, if the regular cash distribution frequency is changed, the latest 12 months of 
distribution may not be available. An example may be when the distribution frequency is 
changed from annual to semi -annual which yields either latest 6 months of distri butions or 
latest 18 months of distributions. In this case, MSCI estimates the current annualized dividend 
by using the latest 6 months of distribution if resulting in a higher amount than the previous 
annualized dividend. If the latest 6 months of distrib ution is lower than the previous annualized 
dividend, MSCI keeps the previous annualized dividend without taking the latest 6 months of 
distribution into consideration.  
In the US and Canada, however, regular cash distributions are annualized by multiplying the 
latest cash distributions by the frequency of the regular cash distributions' payments. This is 
done to capitalize on the regularity of the regular cash distributio ns' information in providing a 
forward -looking approach for the US and Canada.  
MSCI uses dividends per share for two purposes:  
* Dividend yield , which is calculated using the annualized dividend per share figure; and  
* Current Internal Growth Rate ("g") , which is calculated using the dividend payout ratio and 
return on equity.  
Dividend per share is calculated using the gross dividend of a security (i.e., before any 
applicable withholding tax). Capital repayments are usually not subject to withholding tax. 
Special cash dividends, unless they are paid for three consecutive years, and extraordinary 
capital repayments are excluded from the dividend yield calculation.  
Yields are gross, before withholding tax, and take into account special tax credits when 
applicable.  
1.2.5  BOOK VALUE PER SHARE (BVPS)  
MSCI defines book value as shareholders' equity available to shareholders at the latest period 
end date excluding minority interest, treasury shares and preferred shares that do not exhibit 
equity like characteristics.  
MSCI uses the book value per share for three purposes:  
* Price/Book Value , which is calculated using the latest book value per share;  
* Return on Equity (ROE) , which is calculated using the latest book value and the trailing 12 -
month earnings per share figure; and  
* Current Internal Growth Rate ("g") , which is calculated using return on equity and the 
dividend payout ratio.  
 1.3 FORECASTED PER SHARE DATA  
Forecasted variables are based on consensus earnings estimates taken from financial analysts 
as provided by Thomson I/B/E/S for all countries except Japan. For Japan, data from Toyo 
Keizai is used for securities that are not covered by Thomson I/B/E/S. MSC I uses forecasted 
data along with historical data to provide a comprehensive assessment of a company's 
performance.  
MSCI defines two types of earnings per share based on forecasts:  
* EPS 12F = 12 -month forward EPS estimate derived on a rolling basis from the consensus of 
analysts' earnings estimates for the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year.  
EPS 12F=MxEPS1+(12-M)xEPS2
12 
Where  
* EPS 1 is the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for current fiscal year.  
* EPS 2 is the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for the next fiscal year.  
* M is the number of months remaining before the current fiscal year end  
* The current fiscal year corresponds to the fiscal year following the last fiscal year for which 
the company has made its results publicly available  
For cases where EPS 2 is not available and M is greater than or equal to 8, EPS 1 is used as an 
approximation of EPS 12F. 
 
Example:     
Calculating the 12 -month forward earnings as of January 10, 2010:  
 Security A  Security B  Security C  
Latest reported Fiscal Year  Dec 31, 2009  Mar 31, 2009  Dec 31, 2008  
M 11  2  11  
EPS 1 0.64  1.04  1.04  
EPS 1 date  Dec 31, 2010  Mar 31, 2010  Dec 31, 2009  
EPS 2 0.74  1.52  1.52  
EPS 2 date  Dec 31, 2011  Mar 31, 2011  Dec 31, 2010  
EPS 3   1.72  
EPS 3 date    Dec 31, 2011  
EPS12F  0.65  1.44  1.54  
For Security C, the results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009 are not yet available. As a 
result, the EPS 1 estimates still pertain to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. Therefore, in 
order to have meaningful 12 -month forward earnings, the EPS 2 and the EPS 3 are used instead of 
the EPS 1 and EPS 2. 
 
 * EPS 12B = backward 12 -month EPS derived in a similar fashion as the EPS 12F but using the 
EPS from the last reported fiscal year and the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for 
the current fiscal year.  
EPS 12B=MxEPS0+(12-M)xEPS1
12 
Where  
* EPS0 is last fiscal year end reported earnings per share  
* EPS1 is the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for current fiscal year.  
 
EPS12F and/or EPS12B are used to calculate:  
* Price to 12 -month forward earnings; and  
* Short -term forward EPS growth rate  
 
Example:  
Calculating the Short -term forward EPS growth rate as of the January 10, 2010:  
  Security A  Security B  Security C  
Fiscal Year End  Dec 31, 2009  Nov 30, 2009  Mar 31, 2009  
M 11  10  2  
EPS 0 0.50  -0.30  0.89  
EPS 1 0.64  -0.15  1.04  
EPS 2 0.74  0.25  1.52  
      
EPS12 F 0.65  -0.08  1.44  
EPS12 B 0.51  -0.28  1.02  
      
ST fwd EPS G  26.7%  69.7%  41.9%  
 
All forecasted data is refreshed monthly.  
In order to calculate the short -term forward EPS growth rate, if the EPS of the last reported 
fiscal year is missing from the data vendor, then MSCI's last reported fiscal year EPS will be 
used.  
 2 SECURITY RATIOS  
Security ratios are derived using fundamental per share data as defined in the preceding 
section and are used by MSCI to define the investment style of a security.   
MSCI calculates two types of security ratios:  
* Valuation Ratios  
* Other Financial Ratios  
This section provides details on the definitions and computations of the variables used to 
calculate security ratios.  
2.1 VALUATION RATIOS  
In general, all valuation ratios are calculated using the following formula:  
Valuation  Ratios =Current  security  price
Trailing  12-mont h per share figure 
This formula applies to:  
* Price to Sales (P/S)  
* Price to Earnings (P/E)  
* Price to Cash Earnings (P/CE)  
* Price to Book Value (P/BV)  
* Price to Earnings Forward (P/E fwd)  
* While for  
* Dividend Yield (YIELD) we use the inverse of the above formula.  
2.2 OTHER FINANCIAL RATIOS  
2.2.1  LONG -TERM HISTORICAL GROWTH TRENDS  
MSCI calculates two historical growth trends, showing the evolution of fundamental data over 
the last five years.   
* Long -term historical EPS growth trend (EGRO)  
* Long -term historical SPS growth trend (SGRO)  
 
 To calculate the EGRO and SGRO, first MSCI applies a regression using the ordinary least 
square method to the last five -years' EPS and SPS, respectively.  
EPSt=axt+b     SPSt=axt+b 
Where:  
* a, the slope coefficient,  
* b, the intercept,  
* t, the year expressed in number of cumulative months.  
Then, we calculate an average absolute EPS or SPS:  
EPS=|EPSi|
nn
i=1      SPS=|SPSi|
nn
i=1  
Finally, we calculate the growth trend as follows:  
EGRO =aEPS
EPS     SGRO =aSPS
SPS 
 
Example #1      
Calculating the Long -term historical EPS and SPS growth trend  
 Fiscal Year End Date  T EPS SPS  
Fiscal Year End 0  December 31, 2002  0 (1.11)  7.71  
Fiscal Year End 1  December 31, 2003  12 (0.51)  8.19  
Fiscal Year End 2  December 31, 2004  24 0.29  8.57  
Fiscal Year End 3  December 31, 2005  36 0.92  8.87  
Fiscal Year End 4  December 31, 2006  48 1.41  11.5  
     
A   0.05  0.07  
a, annualised    0.65  0.83  
Average Absolute    0.85  8.97  
Growth trend    76.30%  9.20%  
 
 
A minimum of the last four comparable EPS or SPS values is needed to compute the historical 
growth trends. Growth trends for securities without at least four years of comparable EPS or 
SPS data are not calculated and/or used to attribute the style of a sec urity. In order to provide 
meaningful historical growth trends, MSCI may restate EPS and SPS to reflect the impact of 
corporate events that may affect historical financial data  on an on -going basis. Please note that 
the previously published financial data will not be revised.  
 
For certain corporate events where there is a Large  impact on sales and earnings, MSCI will 
determine comparability over a five year period using sales variation which is deemed to be 
more stable as compared to earnings.  
 * Whenever post event annual sales increase by more than 50% or decrease by less than 
33%  and;  
* The variation is determined not to be due to normal continuous business operations ( 
i.e. corporate event, change in accounting standards, or business restructuring):  
MSCI will mark the post event fiscal year reporting as non -comparable in sales  and earnings 
against previous fiscals and drop the 5 year growth rate calculation.  
If only the post event interim sales is published by the company, MSCI will wait for the post 
event annual sales to determine comparability and will continue to publish the pre -event 
fundamental data.  
2.2.2  RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE)  
The following formula is used to calculate return on equity:  
ROE =Trailing  12-mont h earnings  per share
Latest  Book  value  per share 
The ROE, which is expressed in percentage terms, is considered meaningful and calculated only 
if the following conditions are met:  
* the book value is positive;  
* the difference between the book value date and earnings date is less than 18 months;  
* the book value date is equal to or older than the earnings date and;  
* book value and earnings are both consolidated or both non -consolidated.  
Otherwise, the ROE value is considered missing and left blank.  
 
2.2.3  PAYOUT RATIO  
Payout ratio is calculated using the annualized dividend per share divided by the trailing 12 -
month earnings per share.   
Payout =100 *(Dividend  per share
Earnings  per share) 
2.2.4  CURRENT INTERNAL GROWTH RATE (G)  
The following is the formula for current internal growth rate:  
g=ROE x(1-Dividend  Payout  Ratio ) 
Payout ratio is calculated using the annualized dividend per share divided by the trailing 12 -
month earnings per share.   
 ROE is calculated using the trailing 12 -month earnings per share divided by the most recently 
reported book value, as shown is section 2.2.2, entitled "Return on Equity."  
If either the payout ratio or the return on equity is not available, the current internal growth rate 
is not calculated.  
2.2.5  SHORT -TERM FORWARD EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH RATE (EGRSF)  
The EGRSF is a measure of the expected growth of a security over the next 12 months from the 
calculation date.  
The EGRSF is computed as follows:  
EGRSF =EPS 12F-EPS 12B
|EPS 12B| 
2.2.6  LONG -TERM FORWARD EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH RATE (EGRLF)  
The LT fwd EPS G is the consensus of analysts' earnings growth rate estimates typically 
provided for the next 3 to 5 years. In cases where the LT fwd EPS G is considered an outlier 
(greater than 50% or less than -33%) and the corresponding estimate is base d on only one 
contributor, the variable will not be used by MSCI.  
 
2.2.7  EARNINGS VARIABILITY ( EVAR)  
MSCI calculates Earnings V ariability as the standard deviation of year -on-year Earnings per 
Share (EPS) growth in the last five fiscal years.  
 
EVAR = (EPSg i-EPSg  m )2 n
1
n-1  
 
* Where EPSg  i = (EPS i - EPS i-1)/EPS i-1  
* EPSg  m  = mean ( EPSg  i) 
* n denotes number EPS growth data points i.e. 4 in case of earnings variability  
 
 
 
 
 
 Calculating the Earnings Variability  
  Fiscal Year End 
Date  EPS EPS ( gi) 
Fiscal Year End 0  30-Sep-12 4.04    
Fiscal Year End 1  30-Sep-13 5.48  35.64%  
Fiscal Year End 2  30-Sep-14 6.39  16.60%  
Fiscal Year End 3  30-Sep-15 15.41  141.15%  
Fiscal Year End 4  30-Sep-16 28.05  82.02%  
EVAR =Standard  Deviation  (82.02,141 .15,16.60,35.64 )=55.48% 
 
EVAR is calculated using the last 5 fiscal EPS figures , where  
* Y-O-Y EPS growth(year(n)) = (EPS(year(n)) - EPS(year(n -1)))/(EPS(year(n -1))  If 
EPS(year(n -1)) > 0

 3 INDEX RATIO  
In general, index ratios computed by MSCI result from the aggregation of the constituent using 
the methodology that best reflects the underlying index.  
To reflect the underlying index methodology, index ratios are calculated taking into account 
each security's inclusion factor, which consists of the free float -adjustment and the style 
inclusion factor.  For MSCI's international index series, the inclusion factor is the foreign 
inclusion factor (FIF) and for the MSCI's domestic  Indexes, the inclusion factor is the domestic 
inclusion factor (DIF). For the former, the appropriate FIF is multiplied by the value inclusion 
factor (VIF) for the value Indexes and by the growth inclusion factor (GIF) for the growth 
Indexes. For the latt er series (i.e. domestic Indexes), FIF is replaced by DIF.  
MSCI calculates two types of index ratios:  
* Valuation ratios  
* Other Financial Ratios  
The following section details the calculations of these ratios.  
3.1 INDEX VALUATION RATIOS  
MSCI calculates index valuation ratios by aggregating securities using the following formula:  
 (Current security pricexTotal current security shares outstandingx1
Exchange RatexInclusion Factor)n
i=1
 (Trailing 12 -month per share figurexTotal current security shares outstandingx1
Exchange RatexInclusion Factor)n
i=1  
 
where n=number of companies included in the calculation  
If the trailing 12 -month per share figure is not available for a security, that security will be 
excluded from the calculation for that particular ratio.  
This formula applies to:  
* Price to Earnings (P/E)  
* Price to Earnings Forward (P/E Fwd)  
* Price to Earnings Backward (P/E Bwd)  
* Price to Cash Earnings (P/CE)  
* Price to Book Value (P/BV)  
 
 while for  
* Dividend Yield (YIELD) we use the inverse of the above formula.  
3.2 OTHER INDEX FINANCIAL RATIOS  
Other financial ratios calculated by MSCI include the following:  
* Return on Equity (ROE)  
* Payout Ratio  
* Current Internal Growth Rate (g)  
* Short -term Forward EPS Growth Rate (EGRSF)  
* Long -term Growth Rates/Trends  
* 12-month Index EPS  
* Year on Year Growth EPS  
* Estimated Daily Dividend Yield  
3.2.1  RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE)  
Return on equity at an index level, which attempts to show the average return on equity for an 
index, is calculated using the recalculated earnings divided by the recalculated book value, as 
defined by the following formula:  
Index  ROE =Index  P/BV
Index  P/E 
3.2.2  PAYOUT RATIO  
Payout ratio at an index level is calculated using price to earnings and the dividend yield at an 
index level, as defined in the following formula:  
Payout =Index  level  price  to earnings xIndex  dividend  yield  
3.2.3  CURRENT INTERNAL GROWTH RATE (G)  
The current internal growth rate at an index level is calculated using the return on equity and the 
payout ratio at an index level, as defined in the following formula:  
Index  g=Index  ROE x(1-Index  Dividend  Yield  (in %)xIndex  P/E) 
 3.2.4  SHORT -TERM FORWARD EPS GROWTH RATE (EGRSF)  
The short -term forward EPS growth rate is the percentage change between the recalculated 
earnings backward and the recalculated earnings forward. It is calculated using the following 
formula:  
Index   EGRSF =[Index   P/E12B
Index   P/E12F]-1 
* Index P/E12B=Index level Price to Earnings Backward based on EPS12B  for all securities 
included in the index.  
* Index P/E12F=Index level Price to Earnings Forward based on EPS12F  for all securities 
included in the index.  
EPS12F (12 -month forward EPS) and EPS12B (12 -month backward EPS) are as defined in 
section 1.3.  
Price to Earnings Backwards is calculated using the index level valuation ratio formula as 
defined in Section 3.1.  
3.2.5  LONG -TERM GROWTH RATES/TRENDS  
Long -term growth rates and trends at an index level are computed by MSCI from the 
aggregation of the constituents' security level data using the following formula:  
 [Current  share  price xTotal  current  security shares  outstandingx Inclusion  factor
 (Current  share  price xTotal  current  security shares  outstandingx Inclusion  factor )n
i=1xGrowth  Rate ]n
i=1   
where n=number of companies included in the calculation  
This formula applies to:  
* Long -term Forward EPS Growth Rate (EGRLF)  
* Long -term Historical EPS Growth Trend (EGRO)  
* Long -term Historical SPS Growth Trend (SGRO)  
3.2.6  12-MONTH INDEX EPS  
MSCI calculates the 12 -month index EPS by combining an index level with its underlying price to 
earnings ratios, thereby creating a new theoretical per share figure at an index level that reflects 
the evolution of the EPS for an index. MSCI calculates:  
* 12 months trailing Index EPS  
* 12 months forward Index EPS  
 The following formula is used to calculate these 12 -month index ratios:  
12 Mont hs EPS =Index  Level
P/E at Index  Level 
3.2.7  YEAR ON YEAR GROWTH EPS  
Using the 12 -month index EPS, as shown above, MSCI calculates an EPS growth rate for an 
index. Year on year growth EPS relates earnings growth to the index level. Currently, MSCI 
calculates these figures using:  
* 12-Month Index Historical EPS  
* 12-Month Index Forward EPS  
The year on year growth rate is calculated using the following formula:  
Year  on Year  Growth  EPS = 100x ( 12 Months  Index  EPS of the Current  Month -12 months  Index  EPS 12 months  before
|12 months  Index  EPS 12 months  before |)  
For details on index ratio calculation examples, see Appendix II, entitled "Index Ratio 
Calculation Examples."  
3.2.8  ESTIMATED DAILY DIVIDEND YIELD  
In addition to calculating a monthly dividend yield, MSCI computes, every weekday, an 
estimated daily dividend yield, that takes into account annualized dividends and regular capital 
repayments (if applicable), and prices at previous month end where prices are adjusted by the 
month -to-date security performance. The estimated dai ly index yield uses the current security 
weights.  
The estimated daily dividend yield and the monthly yield are calculated for the same Indexes.  
Note that due to different calculation methodologies, the Estimated Daily Dividend Yield at 
month -end date will not correspond to the Monthly Dividend Yield.

the end of the previous month. It is the value of 1 USD in foreign currency.  
* PricePerShare EOPM is the price per share of the security s at the end of the previous month.  
* FXrate EOPM is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs USD at the end of the previous 
month. It is the value of 1 USD in foreign currency.

* FXrate t is the FX rate of the price currency of security s vs USD at time t. It is the value of 1 
USD in foreign currency.  
* InclusionFactor t is the inclusion factor (e.g. Foreign Inclusion Factor, Domestic Inclusion 
Factor, Growth Inclusion Factor, Value Inclusion Factor) of the security s at time t . 
 4 FUNDAMENTAL DATA TREATMENTS FOR CORPORATE EVENTS  
The following section details the treatment of fundamental data to account for a corporate 
event. When a corporate event occurs, MSCI may adjust and/or restate fundamental data in 
order to ensure comparability between the pre and post event data.  
For the treatment of fundamental data, MSCI categorizes corporate events as the following:  
* Nominal Changes in Capital Structure  
* Real Changes in Capital Structure  
* Both Nominal and Real Changes in Capital Structure  
* Changes in Business Structure  
For events such as share buybacks, special cash dividends, and debt -to-equity swaps, no 
adjustment is made generally.  
The policies and guidelines set forth apply in most corporate events. For corporate events not 
described in this section or combinations of different types of corporate events and other 
exceptional cases, MSCI will determine the most appropriate implementa tion method and will 
announce it prior to the changes becoming effective in the MSCI Equity Index Series.  
4.1 NOMINAL CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE  
Nominal changes in capital structure, events that have no effect on the capitalization of a 
security, require fundamental data to be adjusted in the same way that the price of the security 
is adjusted using the price adjustment factor (PAF).  
For fundamental per share data, if the corporate event leads to an increase in the number of 
shares, the adjustment factor will decrease the value of the per share data using the same 
terms of the corporate event. If the corporate event leads to a decrease  in the number of 
shares, the  adjustment factor will increase the value of the per share data using the same terms 
of the corporate event.  
Illustration:  
Split 2:1, with a nominal value change from 50 to 25  
The shareholder exchanges 1 share of nominal 50 against 2 shares of nominal 25.  
The price before split is 100 and the shareholder had 1 share at a price of 100  
Then he has 2 shares which price is : 1*100/ 2 = 50  
The adjustment factor is (ex/cum) 50/100 = 0.50  
Fundamental data per share figures are adjusted by this adjustment factor.  
 In the case of the current dividend rate, if the adjustment factor is between 0.8 and 1.25, no 
adjustment is made. MSCI assumes that any event that leads to an adjustment factor within 
this range will typically not lead to a change in a company's dividend policy.   
Security and index ratios will remain neutral to corporate events that result in nominal changes 
in capital structure because fundamental per share data is adjusted in the same proportion as 
price. Any changes that may be observed are due to price performa nce or company 
fundamental data.  
4.2 REAL CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE  
For all corporate events that involve a real change in capital structure, events that cause a 
change in security market capitalization, a pro forma book value will be calculated in order to 
reflect the incoming or outgoing market capitalization. All other fundamental data will not be 
adjusted for such events including the current dividend rate, except if earnings and/or cash 
earnings are negative.  
Illustration:  
Pro forma book value per share is calculated using the following formula:  
(Latest  BVPS xLatest  number  of company  shares  outstanding )+(Number  of shares  issued xIssue  price )
Number  of shares  after  private  placement  or public  offering  
The number of shares at BVPS date = 1000.  
The book value per share before the public offering is EUR 25.  
Event : Public placement of 100 shares @ EUR 50 per share.  
New BVPS = (1000*25)+(100*50)  
                                 (1000 + 100)  
New BVPS = 27.27  
Adjustment Factor for BVPS = New BVPS/ Old BVPS = 1.09  
If a company has multiple share classes, book value is adjusted by using the total amount of 
capital raised in the issue.  
Security and index ratios will change by the increase or decrease in the number of shares and 
change in price. Price to book value, return on equity, and current internal growth rate, at a 
security and index level, will change based on the new book value p er share.  
 If earnings/cash earnings are negative, an adjustment factor is applied according to the change 
in number of shares (Pre -event number of shares/ Post -event number of shares) in order to 
avoid increasing losses artificially in P/E and P/CE calculations at i ndex level.2 
4.3 BOTH NOMINAL AND REAL CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE  
All corporate events that involve a nominal and real change in capital structure require 
fundamental data to be adjusted in the same way that the price of the security is adjusted using 
the price adjustment factor (PAF) due to the discount the shares are o ffered at in relation to the 
market price, except:  
In the case of the current dividend rate, if the adjustment factor is between 0.8 and 1.25, no 
adjustment is made. MSCI assumes that any event that leads to an adjustment factor within 
this range will typically not lead to a change in a company's dividend policy.   
If earnings or cash earnings are negative, an adjustment factor is applied according to the 
change in number of shares (Pre -event number of shares/ Post -event number of shares) in 
order to avoid increasing losses artificially in P/E and P/CE calculations a t index level.1 
In the case of book value, a pro forma book value will be calculated in order to reflect the 
incoming or outgoing market capitalization.  
4.4 CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRUCTURE  
MSCI defines changes in business structure as events that cause a company's on -going 
business model to substantially change. Events that cause a change in business structure 
include significant events such as significant mergers and acquisitions and early index 
inclusions resulting from spin -offs and IPOs. MSCI uses a threshold of an increase of 50% or 
greater or a decrease of 33% or more, relative to the company's full market capitalization before 
the event to identify such significant events.    
For these significant events, if the post -event entity moves from being a non -constituent to a 
constituent of the Global Investable Market Index or moves from the Small Cap Index to the 
Standard Index, the style characteristics of the affected securities a re reviewed. If the post -
 
2 When a corporate event results in incoming market capitalization and the company reports losses, MSCI adjusts the trailing 12 -month 
EPS. The loss per share will be recalculated using the number of shares after the corporate event to avoid a decrease in ear nings due to 
an increase in market capitalization.  
For certain corporate events, MSCI will use post event shares to calculate the fundamental data per share in cases of events such as 
equity swaps, conversion of debt to equity, dilutive rights, spin off etcetera provided either of following conditions are met:  
* An increase of 50% or greater or a decrease of 33% or more, relative to the company's full market capitalization before the 
event or;  
*  An increase of 50% or greater or a decrease of 33% or more, relative to the company's outstanding shares  before the event  
 
 event entity moves from the Standard Index to the Small Cap Index or remains in the same Size -
Segment Index (with the Large and Mid Cap Indexes being considered as one size index), the 
style characteristics of the affected securities are not reviewed.  
In cases where such a style review is performed, pro forma post -event fundamental data 
provided by the post -event entity is used. If no pro forma post -event fundamental data is 
provided, estimations of proforma fundamental data are performed using actual f igures 
provided by the post -event entity.  
MSCI will also use estimated proforma fundamental data for the acquiring company in 
acquisitions of loss -making companies, provided the acquired loss -making companies meet the 
following conditions:  
* The acquired loss -making company was a constituent of the MSCI Standard Size Segment 
before the acquisition; and  
* The 12 -month trailing losses of the acquired loss -making company exceeded USD 1bn at 
the end of the month previous to the ex -date of the acquisition event.  
For the acquiring company, MSCI will use estimated proforma fundamental data arrived at by 
use of pre -event fundamental data of both the acquiring company and the acquired company. 
Such estimated fundamental data would be used until the time the acquiring company starts 
reporting post -event fundamental data.  
 5 BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION

 MSCI also covers the following Balance Sheet ratio for its Global Equity Model  
* Market leverage (MLEV)  
It is calculated as  MLEV =MCAP +PREF +LD
MCAP 
where MCAP  is the market value of common equity at previous month -end, PREF  is the most 
recent book value of preferred equity, and  LD is the most recent book value of long -term debt.  
* Book leverage (BLEV)  
It is calculated as  BLEV =BV+PREF +LD
BV 
where BV is the most recent book value of common equity, PREF is the most recent book value 
of preferred equity, and LD is the most recent book value of long -term debt.  
* Debt -to-assets (DTOA)  
It is calculated as  DTOA =LD+CL
TA 
where LD is the long -term debt and CL are the current liabilities, and TA is most recent book 
value of total assets.  
 6 HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMIES - ADJUSTMENT OF 
FUNDAMENTAL DATA  
MSCI follows the guidelines provided under FRS (Financial Reporting Standard) 29 to adjust 
fundamental data of companies belonging to hyperinflationary economies. The standard states 
that:  
Hyperinflation is indicated by characteristics of the economic environment of a country, which 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
* The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non -monetary assets or in a relatively 
stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to 
maintain purchasing power;  
* The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in 
terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.  Prices may be quoted in that currency;  
* Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss 
of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;  
* Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and  
* The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.  
Accordingly, MSCI will review the inflation rates of countries on a periodic basis to identify 
cases that meet the above threshold.  
If a country qualifies as a hyperinflationary economy, MSCI  may opt to publish the fundamental 
data and all other security ratios  and growth rates  in a relatively more stable foreign currency 
instead of the currency of the company's country of classification as mentioned in Section 1.1.3  
in order to remove the impact of hyper inflation . 
 APPENDIX I: MSCI'S TREATMENT OF SOME SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF 
IFRS  
Under the regulation adopted by the Council of the European Union, all EU listed companies are 
required to prepare their consolidated financial statements for financial years beginning on or 
after January 1, 2005, in accordance with IFRS. In addition, seve ral companies in other regions 
including Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and China also adopted IFRS 
starting 2005.   EU listed companies that report using United States Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles ('US GAAP') were permitte d to continue doing so until 2007.   
A transition from local GAAP to IFRS impacts the computation of historical long -term earnings 
and sales trends because IFRS earnings and sales numbers may not be comparable with the 
numbers reported using local GAAP. Historical earnings and historical sale s trends over a five -
year period are important components of MSCI's index construction methodology.  
1) MSCI's approach to the treatment of amortization of goodwill : 
In order to make five -year earnings comparable, MSCI will adjust historical [non -IFRS] earnings 
by adding back "amortization of goodwill" for companies where the difference between IFRS 
earnings and non -IFRS earnings is more than or equal to 10%. For compa nies with the largest 
percentage and absolute change in earnings due to the adoption of IFRS, the discontinuation of 
goodwill amortization explains the bulk of the earnings change in a majority of cases. 
'Amortization of goodwill' is also the only item for  which historical pre -IFRS earnings data can 
be consistently adjusted to make it comparable to IFRS data. For further details, please refer to 
MSCI's consultation document -- 'MSCI Consultation on the Treatment of Financial Results 
under IFRS' -- released i n February 2006.  
2) In order to make sales comparable , MSCI will make case -by-case adjustments.  
3) MSCI's approach to the treatment of Gain / Loss due to Revaluation of property : 
'Revaluation of property' can have a large impact on earnings of Real Estate companies. 
Therefore, MSCI adjusts the earnings of real estate companies (i.e., companies falling under the 
GICS Industry Group 'Real Estate' for 'Gain / Loss due to Revaluation o f Investment Property').  
To compute the trailing EPS of a real estate company that has opted to revalue its investment 
property, MSCI adjusts the trailing EPS for the 'Gain / Loss due to Revaluation of Investment 
Property' for the latest trailing period updated by MSCI.  
To compute the Long -term Historical EPS growth trend and to make the five year earnings 
comparable, MSCI adjusts the EPS of fiscals reported by the company under IFRS (December 
2004 onwards) for the 'Gain / Loss due to Revaluation of Investment Property'.  
 
 As a reminder, MSCI calculates:  
1) Long -term Historical EPS growth trend, by performing a regression analysis of the last five 
years' fiscal year -end earnings per share;  
2) Long -term Historical SPS growth trend, by performing a regression analysis of the last five 
years' fiscal year -end sales per share.   
 APPENDIX II: INDEX RATIO CALCULATION EXAMPLES  
This appendix provides examples on how index ratios are calculated.  
The ratios are calculated by dividing the market capitalization of the relevant index by the 
aggregated relevant fundamental data for all securities included in the relevant index.  
MSCI calculates index valuation ratios by aggregating securities using the following formula:  
 (Current  security price xTotal  current  security shares  outstandingx1
Exchange RatexInclusion  Factor )n
i=1
 (Trailing  12-month per share  figure xTotal  current  security shares  outstandingx1
Exchange RatexInclusion  Factor )n
i=1  
where n=number of companies included in the calculation  
If the trailing 12 -month per share figure is not available for a security, that security will be 
excluded from the calculation for that particular ratio.  
This formula applies to:  
* Price to Earnings (P/E)  
* Price to Earnings Forward (P/E Fwd)  
* Price to Earnings Backward (P/E Bwd)  
* Price to Cash Earnings (P/CE)  
* Price to Book Value (P/BV)  
while for  
* Dividend Yield (D/P)  we use the inverse of the above formula  
For Price to Earnings (P/E) and Price to Cash Earnings (P/CE) ratios, the security level per share 
figure is the Trailing 12 -month earnings per share and the Trailing 12 -month cash earnings per 
share respectively.  
 Each example runs a simulation with three securities in an index.

 MSCI calculates the 12 -month index EPS by combining an index level with its underlying price to 
earnings ratios, thereby creating a new theoretical per share figure at an index level that reflects 
the evolution of the EPS for an index. MSCI calculates:  
* 12 months trailing Index EPS  
* 12 months forward Index EPS  
The following formula is used to calculate these 12 -month index ratios:   
 
12 Mont hs EPS =Index  Level
P/E at Index  Level

 APPENDIX III: CORRECTION POLICY  
The rule for Valuation Ratios correction  is as follows:  
The correct valuation ratios (P/E, P/CE, P/Sales, P/BV, and Dividend Yield) are calculated at 
security level and their yields are used to evaluate the impact of the incorrect data on the 
security.  
* If the incorrect security yields are within +-0.25% of the correct yields (+-0.5% for book value yield), 
no revision is done on the country and industry index. No announcement is made by MSCI. Per 
share figures and valuation ratios at security level are revi sed in the MSCI historical database.  
* If the incorrect security yields are not within +-0.25% of the correct yields (+-0.5% for book value 
yield), an announcement is made by MSCI with the revised valuation ratios at the security level.  The 
impact of the incorrect security level data on the country index and industry group is evaluated.  
* If the incorrect index yields at country/industry level are within +-0.1% of the correct yields (+-0.5% 
for book value yield), no index revision is done. No announcement is made by MSCI.  
* If the incorrect index yields are not within +-0.1 of the correct yield (+-0.5% for book value yield), new 
valuation ratios are calculated, for all the Indexes in which the security is included. For all Indexes 
where the incorrect yields lie outside the stated threshold, an announcement is made by MSCI with 
the revised valuation ratios.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represen ted by an index is only available through third party 
investable instruments (if any) based on that index.   MSCI does not issue, s ponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express any opinion regarding any fund, ETF,

Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates i ndexes, but does not manage actual assets. The 
calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. In dex returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to
