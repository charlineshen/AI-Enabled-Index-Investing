 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.  
  
 
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents ("Methodology Set"), including the 
present index methodology document. Please refer to Appendix IV for more details.  
 2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
"Parent Indexes"). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization. The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.

Intelligence . For more information visit  https://www.msci.com/our -solutions/indexes/gics

methodology at https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 3 Maintaining the MSCI Capped Indexes  
3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  
Coinciding with the Index Reviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes, 
the MSCI Capped Indexes are generally rebalanced on the last business day of 
February, May, August and November as described under Section 2 above.  The 
MSCI Capped pro forma inde xes are generally announced nine business days 
before the effective date, unless otherwise specified in the respective 
methodologies.  
Intra -quarter weights will fluctuate according to market movements.  
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined. If the weight of a group 
increases above the maximum intra -quarter weight, the index will be rebalanced 
as described under Section 2 above.  
3.3 Ongoing Event Related Changes  
In general, the MSCI Capped Indexes follow the event maintenance of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes in the Parent Index are reflected 
simultaneously in the MSCI Capped Index.  
3.3.1 Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  
Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  outside of the Quarterly and 
Semi -Annual Index Reviews, such as IPOs, will be added to the MSCI Capped 
Index. The weight of the added security will be capped if required as per Section 
2 above.  
3.3.2 Additions and deletions due to corporate events  
The general treatment of additions and deletions due to corporate events aims at 
reducing turnover in the MSCI Capped Index.  
A security added to the Parent Index following a corporate event (acquisition, 
spinoff or merger) will also be added to the MSCI Capped  index with an 
estimated capped weight.  
A constituent deleted from the Parent Index following a corporate event will be 
simultaneously deleted from the MSCI Capped Index.  
  
 4 Specific Capping Methodologies  
This section describes the specific index capping me thodologies that are 
available as part of the MSCI Capped Indexes methodology:  
4.1 MSCI 10/40 Indexes  
The MSCI 10/40 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 40%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 10/40 Indexes are available at: 
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 
4.2 MSCI 25/50 Indexes  
The MSCI 25/50 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 25%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at eac h index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 
4.3 MSCI 20/20 Indexes  
The MSCI 20/20 Indexes const rain the weight of any single group entity at 20%, 
with a buffer of 10% applied on this limit at each index rebalancing. The MSCI 
20/20 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented as of the 
close of the last  business day of each February, May , August and November, to 
coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 20/20 Indexes 
are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective date. The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day.  
The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an "as needed" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document.  
  
  
4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing.  
The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date. The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. 
The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an "as needed" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document.  
4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index are as described in Sections 2 and 3 
respectively of this document.  
4.6 MSCI 35/65 Indexes  
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest security at 35%, and 
the sum of the weights of the largest five securities at 65%, with a buffer of 5% 
applied on these limits at each index review . The indexes are designed to take 
into ac count the concentration limits defined by the National Commission for the 
Pension System ("Comision Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro" or 
CONSAR) in Mexico.  
 
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are rebalanced on a semi -annual basis, coinciding with 
the May and November  l Index Reviews of  the MSCI Global Investable Market 
 Indexes (GIMI). The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day.  
The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an "as needed" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document.  
Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 
4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple ("L") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
"cap weight" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next. 
Further details of the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/AdptiveCapped .   
4.8 MSCI 10/50  Indexes  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review.  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date.  
Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date.  
 
 Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc.  
# Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index.  
In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints.  
 
 
  
 
5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 
6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules. In the event the number of constituents drops below this minimum, 
MSCI would reduce the buffer value. For more details , please refer to the specific capped  methodology at 
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology

Appendix  II: Methodology for the MSCI Israel Capped 
Index  
The MSCI Israel Capped Index is constructed from the MSCI Israel IMI (the 
"Parent Index"). The MSCI Israel Capped Index is constructed and maintained in 
accordance with the MSCI 25/50 Indexes methodology described in section 4.2, 
effective January 28, 2016.  
Prior to January 28, 2016, the Index was constructed and maintained as per the 
rules described in section 2 for the MSCI Capped Indexes methodology by 
applying a capping constr aint of 24% to the constituents of the Parent Index at 
each Quarterly Index Review.
