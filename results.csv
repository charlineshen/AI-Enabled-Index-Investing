business days before September 1), while the effective date of the Index Review  is 
September 1, the IPO will be added effective September 1. For companies trading on a conditional basis (when -issued trading) prior to their  
listing and unconditional trading, MSCI assess es the inclusion of the company in the 
MSCI Indexes  based on its first day of conditional trading. Deletion of Companies Currently Constituents of the Investable Market 
Indexes during Light Rebalancings  
Existing constituents of the Investable Market Indexes can remain in the Investable 
Market Indexes only if:  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 80% 
respectively for Developed Markets  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 70% 
respectively for Emerging Markets  
If the listing used for an existing constituent no longer meets the above liquidity 
requirements, other eligible listings that do meet such liquidity requirements will be 
used to represent the security in the Market Investable Equity Universe. If the secur ity 
has two or more other eligible listings, the following priority rules would be used to 
determine which of such listings will be used to represent the security in the Market 
Investable Equity Universe:  
* Local listing50 
* Foreign listing in the same geographical region51 
* Foreign listing in a different geographical region52

* Foreign listing in a different geographical region20. Changes in listing from a foreign listing to a local listing for existing constituents will 
be applied even if the foreign listing still meets the liquidity requirements, in cases 
where the local listing has a 12 -month ATVR above two times the minimum level 
requirement of 20% for Developed Markets and 15% for Emerging Markets, i.e., 40%

 calculation of such indexes if over time some companies become eligible for 
inclusion.","Answer: The types of eligible securities selected for the index are based on several criteria. Eligible securities are ranked and selected from the regional Parent Index according to the following criteria: ESG Rating, ESG Trend, current Index membership, industry-adjusted ESG scores, and decreasing free float-adjusted market capitalization. The selection process aims to achieve 50% coverage by cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization within each sector. Securities are selected in the following order: those in the top 35% cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization coverage, 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%, current Index constituents in the top 65%, and remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe.

Source Text: ""For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked Eligible Universe in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization is reached: Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%; 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50% cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 50%; Current Index constituents in the top 65% cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent; Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe.""

after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Indexes . At each Annual Index Review, the Eligible Universe is updated, and the composition of the Index is 
reassessed in order to target 50% free float -adjusted cumulative market capitalization of each sector 
of the Parent Index. 3.1.1  Updating the Eligible Universe  
The Eligible Universe is updated during each Annual Index Review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The pro forma Indexes  are in general announced  nine business 
days before the effective date. For the Quarterly Index Reviews, MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG Controversies Score  assessments 
and MSCI BISR data are taken as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews, i.e., January, 
July and October. For some securities, this data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the 
end of the month preceding the Index Review.

 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power 
generation. Appendix III: Methodology Transition  
June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.","Answer: The eligible securities selected for the index are those that are part of the Parent Index. If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance, additional securities may be temporarily added. These additional securities can include those deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that remain eligible, such as those exhibiting required liquidity and not deleted due to financial difficulties. Additionally, eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, such as the largest small cap size-segment securities if the Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index, may also be considered.

Source Text: ""The securities to be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap size-segment securities if the Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index.""

Intra -quarter weights will fluctuate according to market movements.

2.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and

20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.

Further details of the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/AdptiveCapped . 4.8 MSCI 10/50  Indexes  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
If the weight of a group 
increases above the maximum intra -quarter weight, the index will be rebalanced 
as described under Section 2 above. 3.3 Ongoing Event Related Changes  
In general, the MSCI Capped Indexes follow the event maintenance of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes in the Parent Index are reflected 
simultaneously in the MSCI Capped Index. 3.3.1 Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  
Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  outside of the Quarterly and 
Semi -Annual Index Reviews, such as IPOs, will be added to the MSCI Capped 
Index. The weight of the added security will be capped if required as per Section 
2 above. 3.3.2 Additions and deletions due to corporate events  
The general treatment of additions and deletions due to corporate events aims at 
reducing turnover in the MSCI Capped Index. A security added to the Parent Index following a corporate event (acquisition, 
spinoff or merger) will also be added to the MSCI Capped  index with an 
estimated capped weight. A constituent deleted from the Parent Index following a corporate event will be 
simultaneously deleted from the MSCI Capped Index. 4 Specific Capping Methodologies  
This section describes the specific index capping me thodologies that are 
available as part of the MSCI Capped Indexes methodology:  
4.1 MSCI 10/40 Indexes  
The MSCI 10/40 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 40%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 10/40 Indexes are available at: 
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.2 MSCI 25/50 Indexes  
The MSCI 25/50 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 25%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at eac h index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.3 MSCI 20/20 Indexes  
The MSCI 20/20 Indexes const rain the weight of any single group entity at 20%, 
with a buffer of 10% applied on this limit at each index rebalancing. The MSCI 
20/20 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented as of the 
close of the last  business day of each February, May , August and November, to 
coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 20/20 Indexes 
are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective date."

highest 3 -month ATVR would be used. If an existing constituent of a Standard Index in Emerging Markets fails to meet the 
liquidity requirements, but has a weight of more than 10% in the respective country 
index and its free float adjusted market capitalization is above 0.5 times the Global 
Minimum Size Reference for Emerging Markets, then such constituent will remain in 
the index. However, MSCI would apply a Liquidity Adjustment Factor of 0.5 to the 
weight of the security, an d in the subsequent Index Review , MSCI:  
* Would delete the security from the index if the security does not meet all liquidity 
requirements for existing constituents calculated after applying the Liquidity 
Adjustment Factor; or  
* Would maintain the security in the GIMI and remove the Liquidity Adjustment 
Factor if the security meets all the liquidity requirements for new constituents, 
calculated before applying the Liquidity Adjustment Factor for three  consecutive

current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of MSCI ESG Rating downgrade and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score and/or change in business involvement. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe  
Please see Appendix I for additional details on the ranking and selection rules. 3.2 Quarterly  Index Reviews  
The Indexes are also reviewed on a quarterly basis in February, August and November to coincide 
with the regular Index Reviews of the Parent Indexes.

Reevaluation for continued 
inclusion in the Index will occur at the subsequent 
Index Review. Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events relevant to this Index

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Constructing  the Indexes  
2.1  Underlying  Universe  
The Underlying  Universe for the Indexes is defined by the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable 
Market Indexes ( ""GIMI ""). 2.2  Eligibility Criteria  
The Indexes  use company ratings and research provided by M SCI ESG Research3 to determine 
eligibility for Index inclusion. 2.2.1  ESG Ratings  Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify c ompanies that have demonstrated an ability to 
manage their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are required to have an MSCI ESG  Rating of 
'BB' or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. 2.2.2  ESG Controversies Score Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Controversies Scores  to identify c ompanies that are involved in very 
serious controversies involving the environmental, social, or governance impact of their operations 
and/or products and services. Companies  are required to have an MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 
3 or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes . 2.2.3  Controversial Business  Involvement Criteria  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics to identify c ompanies that are involved in the following business activities. Companies that 
meet the business involvement criteria are excluded from t he Indexes.

 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power 
generation. Appendix III: Methodology Transition  
June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain specific information about the listing requirements for inclusion in the index.

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Intra -quarter weights will fluctuate according to market movements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents (""Methodology Set""), including the 
present index methodology document.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.

 3 Maintaining the MSCI Capped Indexes  
3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  
Coinciding with the Index Reviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes, 
the MSCI Capped Indexes are generally rebalanced on the last business day of 
February, May, August and November as described under Section 2 above. The 
MSCI Capped pro forma inde xes are generally announced nine business days 
before the effective date, unless otherwise specified in the respective 
methodologies.

3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules."

This investability screen is applied at the company level.","Answer: The sector criteria for selecting companies involve targeting 50% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization within each GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index. Companies are selected based on ESG criteria, which include ESG ratings, trends in those ratings, and industry-adjusted ESG scores. Additionally, the selection process involves ensuring that the cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or selecting companies until there are no eligible securities left. The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%, and certain business involvement criteria are applied to exclude companies involved in controversial activities.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.","Answer: The sector criteria used for selecting companies in the MSCI Capped Indexes are based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). Companies can be grouped by sector, industry group, industry, or sub-industry according to this standard.

# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS (r)2)""

https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/169222.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents (""Methodology Set""), including the 
present index methodology document.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Other indexes, such as Large, Mid or Small Market Indexes or indexes based 
on the GICS segmentation may be discontinued if there are no constituents left in 
accordance with the MSCI GIMI methodology. Similarly, MSCI may resume 
 calculation of such indexes if over time some companies become eligible for 
inclusion.

2.2.7  Minimum Length of Trading Requirement  
This investability screen is applied at the individual security level. For an IPO to be eligible for inclusion in a Market Investable Equity Universe, the new 
issue must have started trading at least three months before the implementation of 
an Index Review. This rule is referred to as the Minimum Length of Trading 
Requirement.

10.
When the FOL is reached in these countries, foreign investors may 
trade with each other in an organized local market, frequently at a price higher than  
that available to domestic investors.","Answer: The text does not explicitly mention a specific market capitalization requirement for individual companies to be included in the index. However, it does describe a process where the index targets 50% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization within each GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index. Companies are selected to achieve this target, and the selection process involves ranking eligible securities by various criteria, including decreasing free float-adjusted market capitalization. The methodology aims to cover 50% of the market capitalization in each sector, but it does not specify a minimum market capitalization for individual companies.

Section of Source Text: 2, 4","1.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe  
Please see Appendix I for additional details on the ranking and selection rules. 3.2 Quarterly  Index Reviews  
The Indexes are also reviewed on a quarterly basis in February, August and November to coincide 
with the regular Index Reviews of the Parent Indexes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of MSCI ESG Rating downgrade and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score and/or change in business involvement. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%."
What are the liquidity requirements for companies in the index?,"Answer: The liquidity requirements for companies in the index are as follows: For existing constituents of the Investable Market Indexes, the 3-month Annualized Traded Value Ratio (ATVR) and Frequency of Trading must be at least 5% and 80% respectively for Developed Markets, and at least 5% and 70% respectively for Emerging Markets. If a listing no longer meets these liquidity requirements, other eligible listings that do meet the requirements will be used to represent the security in the Market Investable Equity Universe.

Once companies are assigned to each size -segment, the securities of companies in 
each segment are evaluated for conformity with the additional size -segment 
investability requirements for each size -segment. The securities of newly eligible 
companies and of  companies migrating from the lower segment are required to

If an existing constituent of a Standard Index in Emerging Markets fails to meet the 
liquidity requirements, but has a weight of more than 10% in the respective country 
index and its float adjusted market capitalization is above 0.5 times the Global 
Minimu m Size Reference for Emerging Markets, then such constituent will remain in 
the index. However, MSCI would apply a Liquidity Adjustment Factor of 0.5 to the 
weight of the security, and in the subsequent Index Review , MSCI:  
* Would delete the security from the index if the security does not meet all liquidity 
requirements for existing constituents calculated after applying the Liquidity 
Adjustment Factor or  
* Would maintain the secur ity in the GIMI and remove the Liquidity Adjustment 
Factor if the security meets all the liquidity requirements for new constituents, 
calculated before applying the Liquidity Adjustment Factor for three  consecutive 
Index Reviews or  
* Would continue maintaining the security in the GIMI with the Liquidity Adjustment 
Factor of 0.5 if none of the above conditions are met  
3.1.2.5  GLOBAL MINIMUM FOREIGN INCLUSION FACTOR REQUIREMENT  
New securities with a FIF lower than 0.15 are included in the Market Investable Equity 
Universe if their  free float -adjusted market capitalization meets  1.8 times half of the 
Standard Index Interim Market Size -Segment Cutoff. Interim Market Size -Segment 
Cutoffs are calculated daily in order to determine eligibility for early inclusion of 
securities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
* If it is not, then:  
 The number of companies is decreased until the full market capitalization of the smallest company in 
the size -segment is equal or higher than the lower bound of the Global Minimum Size Range for that 
size-segment. Or,  
 The number of companies is increased to include all companies with a full market capitalization 
higher than the upper bound of the Global Minimum Size Range for that size -segment. The full market capitalization of the last company defines the Market Size -Segment Cutoff for that 
segment and the Segment Number of Companies is set to this company's rank. This process is designed to give priority to global size integrity over market coverage 
in situations where both objectives cannot be achieved simultaneously. For the Investable Market Index, at initial construction, the above process is not 
followed in order to provide as broad a coverage as possible without sacrificing size 
integrity. At initial construction the Market Size -Segment Cutoffs and associated 
Segme nt Number of Companies of the Investable Market segment are derived by 
including all companies equal to or larger than the Global Minimum Size Reference 
for the Investable Market Indexes. Since Size -Segment Indexes are based on company full market capitalization, all 
securities of a company are always classified in the same size -segment. As a result, 
there may be more securities than companies in a given size -segment. The Market Size -Segment Cutoffs and Segment Number of Companies are 
maintained daily, and updated at Index Reviews, additionally taking into account 
index stability and continuity rules. 2.3.4  Assigning Companies to the Size -Segments  
At initial construction, all companies with full market capitalization greater than or 
equal to that of the full market capitalization of the company that defines the Market 
Size -Segment Cutoff are assigned to that size -segment. At  Index Reviews, the company assignment rules additionally take into account, new 
additions, and index continuity and stability rules.

which the effective date of inclusion is either 5 days before the effective date of the

Review . For example, when the effective date of inclusion of the IPO is August 29 (3 
business days before September 1), while the effective date of the Index Review  is 
September 1, the IPO will be added effective September 1. For companies trading on a conditional basis (when -issued trading) prior to their  
listing and unconditional trading, MSCI assess es the inclusion of the company in the 
MSCI Indexes  based on its first day of conditional trading. Deletion of Companies Currently Constituents of the Investable Market 
Indexes during Light Rebalancings  
Existing constituents of the Investable Market Indexes can remain in the Investable 
Market Indexes only if:  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 80% 
respectively for Developed Markets  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 70% 
respectively for Emerging Markets  
If the listing used for an existing constituent no longer meets the above liquidity 
requirements, other eligible listings that do meet such liquidity requirements will be

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
2. Constructing  the Indexes  
2.1  Underlying  Universe  
The Underlying  Universe for the Indexes is defined by the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable 
Market Indexes ( ""GIMI ""). 2.2  Eligibility Criteria  
The Indexes  use company ratings and research provided by M SCI ESG Research3 to determine 
eligibility for Index inclusion. 2.2.1  ESG Ratings  Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify c ompanies that have demonstrated an ability to 
manage their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are required to have an MSCI ESG  Rating of 
'BB' or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. 2.2.2  ESG Controversies Score Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Controversies Scores  to identify c ompanies that are involved in very 
serious controversies involving the environmental, social, or governance impact of their operations 
and/or products and services. Companies  are required to have an MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 
3 or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes . 2.2.3  Controversial Business  Involvement Criteria  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics to identify c ompanies that are involved in the following business activities. Companies that 
meet the business involvement criteria are excluded from t he Indexes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Each regional Index targets 50% of 
the free float -adjusted market capitalization within each  GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
4.2 MSCI ESG Controversies  
MSCI ESG Controversies provide assessments of controversies concerning the potential negative 
environmental, social, and/or governance impact of company operations, products and services. The evaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is designed to be consistent with 
international norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human  Rights, the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score falls on a 0 -10 scale, with ""0"" being th e most severe controversy. The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology  can be found at: 
https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -disclosures . 4.3 MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research  
MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research (BISR) aims to enable institutional investors to 
manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and restrictions reliably and 
efficiently. For more details on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research , please refer to 
https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -disclosures . 4.4 MSCI Climate  Change Metrics  
MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.

New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.","Answer: The text provided does not explicitly mention a free float requirement for inclusion in the index. However, it does state that MSCI employs market capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its free float-adjusted market capitalization. This implies that free float-adjusted market capitalization is a factor in the weighting of the index constituents, but it does not confirm if there is a specific free float requirement for inclusion.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

present index methodology document.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next."

cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

2. Constructing  the Indexes  
2.1  Underlying  Universe  
The Underlying  Universe for the Indexes is defined by the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable 
Market Indexes ( ""GIMI ""). 2.2  Eligibility Criteria  
The Indexes  use company ratings and research provided by M SCI ESG Research3 to determine 
eligibility for Index inclusion. 2.2.1  ESG Ratings  Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify c ompanies that have demonstrated an ability to 
manage their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are required to have an MSCI ESG  Rating of 
'BB' or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. 2.2.2  ESG Controversies Score Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Controversies Scores  to identify c ompanies that are involved in very 
serious controversies involving the environmental, social, or governance impact of their operations 
and/or products and services. Companies  are required to have an MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 
3 or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes . 2.2.3  Controversial Business  Involvement Criteria  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics to identify c ompanies that are involved in the following business activities. Companies that 
meet the business involvement criteria are excluded from t he Indexes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain specific information about the financial viability criteria that companies must meet.

Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

 3 Maintaining the MSCI Capped Indexes  
3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  
Coinciding with the Index Reviews of the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes, 
the MSCI Capped Indexes are generally rebalanced on the last business day of 
February, May, August and November as described under Section 2 above. The 
MSCI Capped pro forma inde xes are generally announced nine business days 
before the effective date, unless otherwise specified in the respective 
methodologies.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."
What is the minimum length of trading or seasoning required?,"Answer: The provided text chunks do not specify a minimum length of trading or seasoning required. The text mentions various conditions related to liquidity requirements, frequency of trading, and inclusion criteria for indexes, but it does not explicitly state a minimum length of trading or seasoning period.

In addition, a minimum level of 50% of 12 -month 
Frequency of Trading is required for the inclusion of a security in an Investable 
Market Equity Universe of a Frontier Market for all liquidity categories. This rule is 
referred to as the Frontier Markets Minimum Liquidity Requirement.

Other indexes, such as Large, Mid or Small Market Indexes or indexes based 
on the GICS segmentation may be discontinued if there are no constituents left in 
accordance with the MSCI GIMI methodology. Similarly, MSCI may resume 
 calculation of such indexes if over time some companies become eligible for 
inclusion.

10.
2.4.1, and for 
which the effective date of inclusion is either 5 days before the effective date of the 
Index Review  or 3 days after, will be made effective to coincide with the Index 
Review . For example, when the effective date of inclusion of the IPO is August 29 (3 
business days before September 1), while the effective date of the Index Review  is 
September 1, the IPO will be added effective September 1. For companies trading on a conditional basis (when -issued trading) prior to their  
listing and unconditional trading, MSCI assess es the inclusion of the company in the 
MSCI Indexes  based on its first day of conditional trading. Deletion of Companies Currently Constituents of the Investable Market 
Indexes during Light Rebalancings  
Existing constituents of the Investable Market Indexes can remain in the Investable 
Market Indexes only if:  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 80% 
respectively for Developed Markets  
* The 3 -month ATVR and Frequency of Trading are at least 5% and 70% 
respectively for Emerging Markets  
If the listing used for an existing constituent no longer meets the above liquidity 
requirements, other eligible listings that do meet such liquidity requirements will be 
used to represent the security in the Market Investable Equity Universe. If the secur ity 
has two or more other eligible listings, the following priority rules would be used to 
determine which of such listings will be used to represent the security in the Market 
Investable Equity Universe:  
* Local listing50 
* Foreign listing in the same geographical region51 
* Foreign listing in a different geographical region52 
 
50 If the security has two or more local listings, then the listing with the highest 3 -month ATVR would be used .","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain specific information regarding the minimum length of trading or seasoning required for securities to be included in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The text discusses various criteria and processes for index inclusion and maintenance, such as ESG ratings and sector coverage, but does not mention a specific minimum trading or seasoning period.

Source Text: The provided text chunks do not contain information about the minimum length of trading or seasoning required.
Section of Source Text: Not applicable.","1.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
Each regional Index targets 50% of 
the free float -adjusted market capitalization within each  GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization

For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe

Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of MSCI ESG Rating downgrade and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score and/or change in business involvement. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain specific information about the minimum length of trading or seasoning required.

If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the

discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not

capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Indexes . At each Annual Index Review, the Eligible Universe is updated, and the composition of the Index is 
reassessed in order to target 50% free float -adjusted cumulative market capitalization of each sector

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."
How is size segmentation determined for the index?,"Answer: Size segmentation for the index is determined through a series of steps that include defining the Market Coverage Target Range for each size segment, determining the Global Minimum Size Range for each size segment, and determining the Market Size-Segment Cutoffs and associated Segment Number of Companies. Companies are then assigned to the size segments based on these criteria. This process is done for each of the three size-segment indexes, namely the Investable Market Index, the Standard Index, and the Large Cap Indexes.

Source Text: ""This is done for each of the three size -segment indexes , namely the Investable Market Index, the Standard Index, and the Large Cap Indexes .

Other indexes, such as Large, Mid or Small Market Indexes or indexes based 
on the GICS segmentation may be discontinued if there are no constituents left in

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each regional Index targets 50% of 
the free float -adjusted market capitalization within each  GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index.

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

Policy Regarding Market Closures during Index Reviews  
During  Index Reviews, the following principles apply in case of market closures on 
the day of implementation.","Answer: The constituent selection process for the index involves several steps and criteria. The index targets 50% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization within each GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index. Companies are selected based on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, which exclude constituents based on involvement in specific business activities, ESG ratings, and exposure to ESG controversies. The selection process includes calculating the cumulative sector coverage at each rank and selecting companies until the cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left. A ""marginal company"" is defined as the one that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50%. If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, it is always selected. If not, it is selected only if its inclusion results in a cumulative sector coverage closer to 50% compared to its exclusion. The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%, and the marginal company is always selected if necessary to achieve this coverage. Securities ineligible as per specific criteria will not be selected even if the cumulative sector coverage is below 50%.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the

Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.

methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

present index methodology document.

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Indexes . At each Annual Index Review, the Eligible Universe is updated, and the composition of the Index is 
reassessed in order to target 50% free float -adjusted cumulative market capitalization of each sector 
of the Parent Index. 3.1.1  Updating the Eligible Universe  
The Eligible Universe is updated during each Annual Index Review.","Answer: The cap for the largest weight in the index depends on the specific MSCI Capped Index being referred to. For example, the MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 10%. The MSCI 25/50 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 25%. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 20%. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:

# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
If the weight of a group 
increases above the maximum intra -quarter weight, the index will be rebalanced 
as described under Section 2 above. 3.3 Ongoing Event Related Changes  
In general, the MSCI Capped Indexes follow the event maintenance of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes in the Parent Index are reflected 
simultaneously in the MSCI Capped Index. 3.3.1 Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  
Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  outside of the Quarterly and 
Semi -Annual Index Reviews, such as IPOs, will be added to the MSCI Capped 
Index. The weight of the added security will be capped if required as per Section 
2 above. 3.3.2 Additions and deletions due to corporate events  
The general treatment of additions and deletions due to corporate events aims at 
reducing turnover in the MSCI Capped Index. A security added to the Parent Index following a corporate event (acquisition, 
spinoff or merger) will also be added to the MSCI Capped  index with an 
estimated capped weight. A constituent deleted from the Parent Index following a corporate event will be 
simultaneously deleted from the MSCI Capped Index. 4 Specific Capping Methodologies  
This section describes the specific index capping me thodologies that are 
available as part of the MSCI Capped Indexes methodology:  
4.1 MSCI 10/40 Indexes  
The MSCI 10/40 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 40%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 10/40 Indexes are available at: 
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.2 MSCI 25/50 Indexes  
The MSCI 25/50 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 25%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at eac h index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.3 MSCI 20/20 Indexes  
The MSCI 20/20 Indexes const rain the weight of any single group entity at 20%, 
with a buffer of 10% applied on this limit at each index rebalancing. The MSCI 
20/20 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented as of the 
close of the last  business day of each February, May , August and November, to 
coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 20/20 Indexes 
are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly."

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Thermal Coal Power  
 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power 
generation. Appendix III: Methodology Transition  
June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

Intra -quarter weights will fluctuate according to market movements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).

criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above

3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization

For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the

* Thermal Coal Power  
 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power 
generation. Appendix III: Methodology Transition  
June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.","Answer: Yes, there are other caps applied to the index. The MSCI Capped Indexes apply maximum weight constraints to groups of constituents based on various criteria such as country, region, sector, industry, stock exchange, currency, group entity, or issuer. Additionally, specific indexes like the MSCI 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35% and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index rebalancing. The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index constrains the weight of any country at 15%.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes are implemented as 
of the cl ose of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
 
4 https://www.msci.com/index -methodology  
 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
The changes resul ting from the rebalancing are announced on the same 
day. The MSCI 20/35 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/35 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index  
The MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index is a sub -set of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
that excludes Brazil, I ndia and China. In addition , the weight of any country is 
constrained at 15%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."

Each regional Index targets 50% of 
the free float -adjusted market capitalization within each  GICS sector of the underlying Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

Section 2.","Answer: The capping process for the MSCI Capped Indexes involves several steps. Firstly, the indexes are constructed from underlying MSCI indexes, known as Parent Indexes. For each capped index, a criterion is defined for grouping constituents of the Parent Index, and a maximum weight is applied to these groups. Constituents can be grouped by various criteria such as country, sector, or issuer. At construction and each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent Index exceeds the maximum weight, it is capped at this maximum. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in proportion to their free float-adjusted market capitalization. Additionally, the weight of securities outside of the capped group is increased in proportion to their weight before capping.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
If the weight of a group 
increases above the maximum intra -quarter weight, the index will be rebalanced 
as described under Section 2 above. 3.3 Ongoing Event Related Changes  
In general, the MSCI Capped Indexes follow the event maintenance of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. Changes in the Parent Index are reflected 
simultaneously in the MSCI Capped Index. 3.3.1 Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  
Early inclusions of new securities to the Parent Index  outside of the Quarterly and 
Semi -Annual Index Reviews, such as IPOs, will be added to the MSCI Capped 
Index. The weight of the added security will be capped if required as per Section 
2 above. 3.3.2 Additions and deletions due to corporate events  
The general treatment of additions and deletions due to corporate events aims at 
reducing turnover in the MSCI Capped Index. A security added to the Parent Index following a corporate event (acquisition, 
spinoff or merger) will also be added to the MSCI Capped  index with an 
estimated capped weight. A constituent deleted from the Parent Index following a corporate event will be 
simultaneously deleted from the MSCI Capped Index. 4 Specific Capping Methodologies  
This section describes the specific index capping me thodologies that are 
available as part of the MSCI Capped Indexes methodology:  
4.1 MSCI 10/40 Indexes  
The MSCI 10/40 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 40%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 10/40 Indexes are available at: 
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.2 MSCI 25/50 Indexes  
The MSCI 25/50 Indexes constrain the weight of any single group entity at 25%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at eac h index 
rebalancing. Further details of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index -methodology . 4.3 MSCI 20/20 Indexes  
The MSCI 20/20 Indexes const rain the weight of any single group entity at 20%, 
with a buffer of 10% applied on this limit at each index rebalancing. The MSCI 
20/20 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly. Changes are implemented as of the 
close of the last  business day of each February, May , August and November, to 
coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 20/20 Indexes 
are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective date.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."

of 50%  
The MSCI ESG Leaders  Indexes  target  50% coverage of the free  float -adjusted market capitalization 
of each GICS sector of the regional Parent Index. The underlying principle in the construction of the 
indexes is to achieve cumulative sector coverage closest to 50%, while aiming to maintain index 
stability. The following guidelines are used in achieving the target cumulative sector coverage of 50%:  
* For each sector, the eligible companies of the regional Parent Index are first ranked based on the 
company level ESG Rating. * If two companies have the same ESG Rating, the company with better ESG Trend is given 
priority. ESG Trend is defined as the direction of the change in ESG Rating as of the latest review 
of the ESG Rating for a company. - Positive ESG Trend is given the highest priority. Positive ESG Trend indicates any upgrade in ESG Rating of 
any scale as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. - Neutral ESG Trend indicates an unchanged ESG Rating as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. Also, companies that receive a re -initiated ESG Rating due to a change in the ESG Ratings Industry are 
considered to have a neutral ESG Trend. - Negative ESG Trend is given the lowest priority. Negative ESG Trend indicates any downgrade in ESG Rating 
of any scale as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. * In case of two companies with the same ESG Rating  and the same ESG Trend, the existing ESG 
Leaders index constituent is given priority to maintain index stability. Between two existing 
constituents with the same ESG Rating  and the same ESG Trend, the company with the higher 
industry -adjusted ESG score is given priority. For two existing ESG Leaders Index constituents 
with the same industry -adjusted ESG score, the security with the largest free float -adjusted 
market capitalization is given priority.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

The pro forma Indexes  are in general announced  nine business 
days before the effective date. For the Quarterly Index Reviews, MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG Controversies Score  assessments 
and MSCI BISR data are taken as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews, i.e., January, 
July and October. For some securities, this data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the 
end of the month preceding the Index Review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -
disclosures .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe  
Please see Appendix I for additional details on the ranking and selection rules. 3.2 Quarterly  Index Reviews  
The Indexes are also reviewed on a quarterly basis in February, August and November to coincide 
with the regular Index Reviews of the Parent Indexes.

Also, screens for

The MSCI Country and Region ESG Leaders Indexes are constructed with an aim to represent the 
performance of companies that have high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance. The MSCI Country ESG Leaders Indexes aim to target sector weights that reflect the relative sector 
weights of the underlying country Index to limit the systematic risk and country specific risk 
introduced by the ESG selection process. Currently the MSCI Country ESG Leaders Indexes can be 
constructed for the Standard size -segment in any Developed and Emerging Markets. The MSCI Region ESG Leaders Indexes can be constructed for regions different than those used in 
the construction of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes and aim to target sector weights that reflect the 
relative sector weights of the underlying regional Index. Currently the MSCI Region ESG Leaders 
Indexes can be constructed for the Standard size -segment in any regions in Developed and 
Emerging Markets. The MSCI Country and Region ESG Leaders Indexes are constructed by applying the index 
construction rules detailed in Section 2 at the level of the respective country or region covered by the 
index, instead of the specific regional level used in the construction of MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI Country and Region ESG Leaders Indexes target 50% of the free float -adjusted market 
capitalization of each GICS sector of the Parent Country or Region Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

The MSCI 35/65 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest security at 35%, and 
the sum of the weights of the largest five securities at 65%, with a buffer of 5% 
applied on these limits at each index review . The indexes are designed to take 
into ac count the concentration limits defined by the National Commission for the 
Pension System (""Comision Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro"" or 
CONSAR) in Mexico. The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are rebalanced on a semi -annual basis, coinciding with 
the May and November  l Index Reviews of  the MSCI Global Investable Market 
 Indexes (GIMI).

Changes are implemented a s

4.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next.

If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap

Eligible securities are ranked within each sector of the regional Parent Index using the following criteria: ESG Rating, ESG Trend (with a preference for positive trends), current Index membership, industry-adjusted ESG scores, and decreasing free float-adjusted market capitalization. The selection process involves choosing securities from this ranked universe to achieve a target 50% coverage by cumulative free float-adjusted market capitalization. This selection includes securities in the top 35% of cumulative coverage, 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%, current Index constituents in the top 65%, and then remaining eligible securities.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3

# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Existence of qualifying conditions for international investors.","Answer: The controversies score affects inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes by determining eligibility based on the ESG Controversies Score. Specifically, existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they have an MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above. Securities with an ESG Controversies Score of 0 are excluded from the Indexes, as they receive a Red controversy flag, indicating significant controversies.

Source Text: ""Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the following conditions: * MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above * MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above * Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3""

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the

this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

international norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human  Rights, the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score falls on a 0 -10 scale, with ""0"" being th e most severe controversy. The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology  can be found at:

exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular

MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent

Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."

MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%.

international norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human  Rights, the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score falls on a 0 -10 scale, with ""0"" being th e most severe controversy. The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology  can be found at:

MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research (BISR) aims to enable institutional investors to 
manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and restrictions reliably and 
efficiently. For more details on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research , please refer to 
https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -disclosures . 4.4 MSCI Climate  Change Metrics  
MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

MSCI Impact Monitor earlier incorporated exclusion rules based on controversial business 
involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power, conventional 
weapons and controversial weapons. Therefore, additional exclusion rules based on the 
controversial business involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power, conventional weapons and controversial weapons that were incorporated in the old 
MSCI Impact Monitor scores  were introduced as part of the methodology  of the MSCI ESG 
Leaders Indexes. The details of the exclusion rules are mentioned in Appendix II. June 2018  
Prior to the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes 
could be maintained in the eligible universe if their MSCI ESG Rating was 'B' or above. Effective from 
the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents  are required to have MSCI ESG Rating of 
'BB' or above in order to be maintained in the eligible universe. December 2020  
Effective from the November 2020 Index Review, the controversial business involvement criteria 
have been enhanced to reflect the framework designed by MSCI ESG Research to define significant 
involvement in controversial activities. According to this framew ork, there are four restrictiveness 
levels: Most Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least Restrictive.","Answer: I don't have enough information to provide a complete answer regarding the policy on thermal coal mining.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Changes are implemented a s

date.

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules."

# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%.

MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights."

49 Applicable only for securities still subject to FOLs.","Answer: The provided text does not explicitly state whether fossil fuel reserves are included or excluded. However, it does mention that fossil fuel extraction is screened, specifically noting that companies deriving 5% or more aggregate revenue from thermal coal mining and unconventional oil and gas extraction are considered. This implies that there is some level of screening or restriction related to fossil fuel extraction, but it does not directly address the inclusion or exclusion of fossil fuel reserves themselves.

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria  
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of MSCI ESG Rating downgrade and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score and/or change in business involvement. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the 
Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Index between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted below, securities will be added to the index only if added to the 
Parent Index.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

The changes are implemented at the end of 
February, August and November.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and

20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly."

cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%.

""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

Further details of the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/AdptiveCapped . 4.8 MSCI 10/50  Indexes  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.

MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.","Answer: I don't have enough information to provide a complete answer regarding the policy on tobacco companies. The provided text chunks do not mention any specific policy related to tobacco companies.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

Therefore, in order to minimize turnover, a buffer of 10% is used on the target coverage of 
50% to define under -representation. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance  
The following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the

""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming 
ineligible because of MSCI ESG Rating downgrade and/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score and/or change in business involvement. EVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    
 
New additions to the Parent Index  New securities added to the Parent Index (such as 
IPOs, other early inclusions and migrations from a 
different size -segment) will be added to the Indexes 
on the date of security inclusion only if they meet the 
eligibility criteria described in Section 2.2 and the 
market capitalization coverage of the sector to which 
the security belongs is less than 45%. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an 
existing Index constituent will not be added to the 
Indexes at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at 
the subsequent Index Review. Merger/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -
Index constituent, the existing constituent will be 
deleted from the Index and the acquiring non -
constituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if 
there are changes in characteristics (country, sector, 
size segment, etc.).

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Indexes . At each Annual Index Review, the Eligible Universe is updated, and the composition of the Index is 
reassessed in order to target 50% free float -adjusted cumulative market capitalization of each sector 
of the Parent Index. 3.1.1  Updating the Eligible Universe

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Further details of the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/AdptiveCapped . 4.8 MSCI 10/50  Indexes  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.

20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.

constraints as specified above (without the buf fer) are breached. The 
rebalancing will take place as of the close of the day when the index breaches 
the constraints, so that the MSCI 20/35 Index will always be within the 
constraints before the opening of the following trading day. The other index 
const ruction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 20/35 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. 4.5 MSCI EM Beyond BIC Index

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules."

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 MSCI  ESG Ratings  
MSCI ESG Ratings  aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks  and opportunities. MSCI  ESG Rating s use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score (0 -10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA ' to 'CCC' , indicating how an entity  manages relevant  key issue s 
relative to industry peers . The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -

MSCI Impact Monitor earlier incorporated exclusion rules based on controversial business 
involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power, conventional 
weapons and controversial weapons. Therefore, additional exclusion rules based on the 
controversial business involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power, conventional weapons and controversial weapons that were incorporated in the old 
MSCI Impact Monitor scores  were introduced as part of the methodology  of the MSCI ESG 
Leaders Indexes. The details of the exclusion rules are mentioned in Appendix II. June 2018  
Prior to the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes 
could be maintained in the eligible universe if their MSCI ESG Rating was 'B' or above. Effective from 
the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents  are required to have MSCI ESG Rating of 
'BB' or above in order to be maintained in the eligible universe. December 2020  
Effective from the November 2020 Index Review, the controversial business involvement criteria 
have been enhanced to reflect the framework designed by MSCI ESG Research to define significant 
involvement in controversial activities. According to this framew ork, there are four restrictiveness 
levels: Most Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least Restrictive.

of 50%  
The MSCI ESG Leaders  Indexes  target  50% coverage of the free  float -adjusted market capitalization 
of each GICS sector of the regional Parent Index. The underlying principle in the construction of the 
indexes is to achieve cumulative sector coverage closest to 50%, while aiming to maintain index 
stability. The following guidelines are used in achieving the target cumulative sector coverage of 50%:  
* For each sector, the eligible companies of the regional Parent Index are first ranked based on the 
company level ESG Rating. * If two companies have the same ESG Rating, the company with better ESG Trend is given 
priority. ESG Trend is defined as the direction of the change in ESG Rating as of the latest review 
of the ESG Rating for a company. - Positive ESG Trend is given the highest priority. Positive ESG Trend indicates any upgrade in ESG Rating of 
any scale as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. - Neutral ESG Trend indicates an unchanged ESG Rating as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. Also, companies that receive a re -initiated ESG Rating due to a change in the ESG Ratings Industry are 
considered to have a neutral ESG Trend. - Negative ESG Trend is given the lowest priority. Negative ESG Trend indicates any downgrade in ESG Rating 
of any scale as of the latest review of the company's ESG Rating. * In case of two companies with the same ESG Rating  and the same ESG Trend, the existing ESG

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 Rebalancing due to non -compliance  
A maximum intra -quarter weight may be defined.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.

The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly."

# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

MSCI Impact Monitor earlier incorporated exclusion rules based on controversial business 
involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power, conventional 
weapons and controversial weapons. Therefore, additional exclusion rules based on the 
controversial business involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power, conventional weapons and controversial weapons that were incorporated in the old 
MSCI Impact Monitor scores  were introduced as part of the methodology  of the MSCI ESG 
Leaders Indexes. The details of the exclusion rules are mentioned in Appendix II. June 2018  
Prior to the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes 
could be maintained in the eligible universe if their MSCI ESG Rating was 'B' or above. Effective from 
the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents  are required to have MSCI ESG Rating of 
'BB' or above in order to be maintained in the eligible universe. December 2020  
Effective from the November 2020 Index Review, the controversial business involvement criteria 
have been enhanced to reflect the framework designed by MSCI ESG Research to define significant 
involvement in controversial activities. According to this framew ork, there are four restrictiveness 
levels: Most Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least Restrictive.

4.2 MSCI ESG Controversies  
MSCI ESG Controversies provide assessments of controversies concerning the potential negative

international norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human  Rights, the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies 
Score falls on a 0 -10 scale, with ""0"" being th e most severe controversy. The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology  can be found at: 
https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -disclosures . 4.3 MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research  
MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research (BISR) aims to enable institutional investors to 
manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and restrictions reliably and 
efficiently. For more details on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research , please refer to 
https://www.msci.com/legal/disclosures/esg -disclosures . 4.4 MSCI Climate  Change Metrics  
MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.

The Underlying  Universe for the Indexes is defined by the constituents of the MSCI Global Investable 
Market Indexes ( ""GIMI ""). 2.2  Eligibility Criteria  
The Indexes  use company ratings and research provided by M SCI ESG Research3 to determine 
eligibility for Index inclusion. 2.2.1  ESG Ratings  Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify c ompanies that have demonstrated an ability to 
manage their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are required to have an MSCI ESG  Rating of 
'BB' or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. 2.2.2  ESG Controversies Score Eligibility  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Controversies Scores  to identify c ompanies that are involved in very 
serious controversies involving the environmental, social, or governance impact of their operations 
and/or products and services. Companies  are required to have an MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 
3 or above to be eligible for inclusion in the Indexes . 2.2.3  Controversial Business  Involvement Criteria  
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics to identify c ompanies that are involved in the following business activities. Companies that 
meet the business involvement criteria are excluded from t he Indexes.

 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.","Answer: I don't have enough information to provide a complete answer regarding the criteria that apply to genetically modified organisms. The provided text chunks do not contain any information related to genetically modified organisms.

# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly."

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative 
sector coverage after selection of all eligible securities is below 50%. Appendix II: Controversial Business Involvement Criteria

weapons and controversial weapons. Therefore, additional exclusion rules based on the 
controversial business involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power, conventional weapons and controversial weapons that were incorporated in the old 
MSCI Impact Monitor scores  were introduced as part of the methodology  of the MSCI ESG 
Leaders Indexes. The details of the exclusion rules are mentioned in Appendix II. June 2018  
Prior to the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes 
could be maintained in the eligible universe if their MSCI ESG Rating was 'B' or above. Effective from 
the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents  are required to have MSCI ESG Rating of

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

* The cumulative sector coverage at each rank is calculated. * In each sector, companies are selected as per the rules mentioned in Section 3.1.2 until the 
cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative

MSCI Impact Monitor earlier incorporated exclusion rules based on controversial business 
involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power, conventional 
weapons and controversial weapons. Therefore, additional exclusion rules based on the 
controversial business involvement criteria related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power, conventional weapons and controversial weapons that were incorporated in the old 
MSCI Impact Monitor scores  were introduced as part of the methodology  of the MSCI ESG 
Leaders Indexes. The details of the exclusion rules are mentioned in Appendix II. June 2018  
Prior to the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes 
could be maintained in the eligible universe if their MSCI ESG Rating was 'B' or above. Effective from 
the May 2018 Annual Index Review, existing constituents  are required to have MSCI ESG Rating of 
'BB' or above in order to be maintained in the eligible universe. December 2020  
Effective from the November 2020 Index Review, the controversial business involvement criteria 
have been enhanced to reflect the framework designed by MSCI ESG Research to define significant 
involvement in controversial activities. According to this framew ork, there are four restrictiveness 
levels: Most Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least Restrictive.

MSCI Climate Change Metrics  provide climate data & tools to support institutional investors seeking 
to integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes 
investors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and report ing on climate risk 
exposure, implementing low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature 
pathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular 
through climate  scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks. The dataset spans across the four dimensions of a climate strategy: transition risks, green 
opportunities, physical risks and 1.5deg alignment.","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain any information regarding how nuclear weapons involvement affects inclusion in an index or ETF. Therefore, I don't have enough information to provide a complete answer to your query.

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

* Thermal Coal Power  
 All companies deriving 5% or more revenue (either reported or estimated) from  thermal coal -based power

June 2013  
Prior to the May 2013 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed using Global 
Socrates ESG Ratings. Effective May 2013 Index Review, MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes transitioned to 
MSCI ESG IVA Ratings. Any company that had an ESG Rating of 'CC C' of lower was not eligible for 
inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes were constructed by 
targeting 50% of the free float -adjusted market capitalization of each GICS sector of the underlying 
MSCI regional ESG Leaders Ind ex. June 2016  
Effective May 2016 Index Review, the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes reflected enhancements to the 
MSCI ESG Controversies (formerly known as MSCI Impact Monitor). The details of the changes are 
as given below. The changes to MSCI ESG Controversies included adjusting the scoring model to align the scores 
with individual controversy case levels, including the introduction of an Orange flag, and the removal 
of specific controversial business involvement (CBI) crite ria from the model to refocus the ESG 
Controversies scores on event -driven controversies. MSCI implemented the following changes to the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes methodology effective 
June 1, 2016 to maintain consistency with the existing index construction objectives:  
1. As per the old MSCI ESG Impact Monitor methodology, securities which had an Impact 
Monitor score of 0 and 1 had a Red controversy flag. Under the new methodology, only 
securities with an ESG controversies score of 0 have a Red controversy flag. For indexes 
where constituents were ineligible to be included in the index if their Impact Monitor score 
was 0 or 1 (current Red controversy flag), the exclusion criteria was changed to ESG 
Controversies score = 0 in order to continue to only exclude secur ities wit h Red controversy 
flag in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes. 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Indexes . At each Annual Index Review, the Eligible Universe is updated, and the composition of the Index is 
reassessed in order to target 50% free float -adjusted cumulative market capitalization of each sector 
of the Parent Index. 3.1.1  Updating the Eligible Universe  
The Eligible Universe is updated during each Annual Index Review.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
Companies that are currently not constituents of the Indexes are evaluated using the same eligibility 
criteria described in Section 2.2. Existing constituents of the Indexes are maintained in the Eligible Universe if they meet all the 
following conditions:  
* MSCI ESG Rating of 'BB' or above  
* MSCI ESG Controversies Score of 1 or above  
* Not screened by the business involvement criteria described in Section 2.2.3 
3.1.2  Ranking  of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index as described in Section 2.2 are 
ranked based on the following criteria:  
* ESG Rating  
* ESG Trend (positive ESG Trend preferred to neutral ESG Trend and neutral ESG Trend preferred 
to negative ESG Trend)5 
* Current Index membership (existing constituents above non -constituents of the Indexes)  
* Industry -adjusted ESG scores  
* Decreasing free float -adjusted market capitalization  
 
4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes. 5 Please refer to Appendix I for more details. 3.1.3  Selection of Eligible Securities  
For each sector, eligible securities of the regional Parent Index are then selected from the ranked 
Eligible U niverse in the following order until the target 50% coverage by cumulative free float -
adjusted market capitalization is reached:  
* Securities in the top 35% cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization coverage of the 
ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative coverage above 35%  
* 'AAA' and 'AA' rated securities in the top 50%  cumulative free float -adjusted market 
capitalization coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the 
cumulative coverage above 50%  
* Current Index constituents in the top 65%  cumulative free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of the ranked universe, including the first security that increases the cumulative 
coverage above 65% if that security is a current index constituent  
* Remaining eligible securities in the ranked universe

2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
Changes are implemented a s 
of the close of the last business day of each February, May, August and 
November, to coincide with the Index Reviews of their Parent Indexes . The MSCI 
20/35 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business days before the effective 
date.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.

Further details of the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes are available at:  
https://www.msci.com/index/methodology/latest/AdptiveCapped . 4.8 MSCI 10/50  Indexes  
The MSCI 10/50 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group e ntity at 10%, 
and the sum of the weights of all group entities representing more than 5% 
weight at 50%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at each index review. The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.
The 
changes resulting from the rebalancing are announced on the same day. The MSCI 20/20 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis. This 
means that a MSCI 20/20 Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the 
constraints as specified above (without the buffer) are breached, so that the 
MSCI 20/20 Index will always be within the constraints before the opening of the 
following trading day. The other index construction and index maintenance rules 
for the MSCI 20/20 Indexes are as described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of 
this document. 4.4 MSCI 20/35 Indexes  
The MSC I 20/35 Indexes constrain the weight of the largest group entity at 35%, 
and all other group entities at 20%, with a buffer of 10% applied on these limits at 
each index rebalancing. The MSCI 20 /35 Indexes  are rebalanced quarterly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.
The MSCI 35/65 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. The changes resulting from the rebalancing are 
announced on the same day. The M SCI 35/65 Indexes are also rebalanced on an ""as needed"" basis to 
maintain the 35/65 constraints on any given day. This means that a MSCI 35/65 
Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the constraints as specified 
above (without the buffer) are br eached. The rebalancing will take place as of the 
close of the day when the index breaches the constraints, so that the MSCI 35/65 
Index will be within the constraints at the opening of any day. The other index 
construction and index maintenance rules for the MSCI 35/65 Indexes are as 
described in Sections 2 and 3 respectively of this document. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes4, Minimizing the tracking error between the 
MSCI 35/65 Index and the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a 
reasonabl e level, is another important objective of the current methodology. This 
is achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 35/65 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the MSCI 
35/65 Index and the Parent Inde x. 4.7 MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes  
For the MSCI Adaptive Capped Indexes, a maximum multiple (""L"") of the 
benchmark weight of the corresponding Parent Index is set. The MSCI Adaptive 
Capped Indexes then constrain the weight of any single security to the level of a 
""cap weight"" derived using this maximum benchmark multiple L. All the 
securities from the underlying index having weights higher than the derived cap 
weight are constrained to the cap weight. Remaining securities are assigned a 
weight that is equivale nt to L multiplied by the weight of the security in the 
underlying index. The cap weight can change from one Index Review to the next."

The 
approach used by MSCI aims to reflect the views and practices of the international 
investment community by striking a balance between a  country's economic 
development and the accessibility of its market while preserving index stability. The MSCI Market Classification Framework consists of following three criteria: 
economic development, size and liquidity as well as market accessibility. In order to be classified in a given investment universe, a country must meet the 
requirements of all three criteria as described in the table below. The economic development criterion is only used in determining the classification of 
Developed Markets while that distinction is not relevant between Emerging and 
Frontier Markets given the very wide variety of development levels within each of 
these two universes.","Answer: The provided text chunks do not contain specific information about the minimum sustainable investments required globally.

cumulative sector coverage crosses 50% or there are no eligible securities left to be selected. * MSCI defines the company that increases the cumulative sector coverage above 50% as the 
""marginal company"". If the marginal company is a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is always selected. If the marginal company is not a current ESG Leaders Index constituent, then it is selected only if the 
cumulative sector coverage with the marginal company is closer to 50% compared to the cumulative sector 
coverage without the marginal company. * The minimum cumulative sector coverage is set to 45%. The marginal company is always selected if this is required to achieve cumulative sector coverage of 45%. * Securities which are ineligible as per Section 3.1.1 will not be selected even if the cumulative

MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four levels of restrictiveness: Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive, Least R estrictive.

For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published 
after the end of month, when available, for the rebalancing of  the Indexes . At the Quarterly Index Reviews, existing constituents are deleted from the Indexes  if they do not 
meet the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1.1. Existing constituents that meet the eligibility 
criteria are retained in the index. Additions, from the eligible securities as per Section 2.2, are made only to those sectors where the 
current market capitalization coverage is less than 45%, until the 50% target is reached. Market price movements may cause small deviations in the sector coverage between two Index 
Reviews.

 1. Introduction  
The MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes ('the Indexes') are free float -adjusted market capitalization -weighted 
indexes designed to represent the performance of  companies that are selected from an underlying 
index based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria exclude  
constituents based on involvement in specific business activities , as well as  ESG ratings and 
exposure to  ESG controversies. The Indexes are derived from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent 
Indexes"") and aim to achieve sector we ights that reflect the sector weights of the corresponding 
Parent Index es. The Index construction targets 50% free float -adjusted market capitalization 
coverage of each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS(r))1 sector by selecting constituents 
primarily based on criteria including the ESG rating, the trend in that rating and the company's 
industry -adjusted ESG score. Currently, MSCI constructs the Indexes for the Standard size -segment in all Developed and Emerging 
Markets and the Small Cap size -segment in the USA2.

 1 Introduction to the MSCI Capped Indexes  
In calculating its international equity indexes, MSCI employs market 
capitalization weighting where each constituent in the index is weighted by its 
free float -adjusted market capitalization. Applying free float -adjusted market 
capitalization weighting may result in large sector, geographical or company 
concentration  in certain cases. MSCI Capped Indexes are designed to provide an 
alternative to purely free float -adjusted market capitalization weighted indexes by 
constraining the maximum sector, geographical or constituent weights.1  
In addition to the MSCI Capped Indexes, MSCI constructs and calculates th e 
MSCI 10/40 Indexes, MSCI 25/50 Indexes , MSCI 35/65 Indexes  and MSCI 10/50 
Indexes . These indexes are specifically intended for funds subject to regulatory 
constraints on maximum weights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
2 Constructing the MSCI Capped Indexes  
The MSCI Capped Indexes are  constructed from underlying MSCI indexes (herein, 
""Parent Indexes""). For each capped index, the following is defined:  
# a criterion for grouping constituents of the Parent Index  
# the maximum weight to be applied for such groups  
Constituents of the Parent Ind ex can be grouped as follows:  
# by country or region  
# by sector, industry group, industry or sub -industry, based on the Global Industry 
Classification Standard (GICS (r)2) 
# by stock exchange or currency of price  
# by group entity3 
# by issuer  
# each constituent may be considered as a single group  
At construction and at each rebalancing, if the weight of any group in the Parent 
Index is greater than the maximum weight, its weight will be capped at the 
maximum weight. Within the capped group, securities are weighted in  proportion 
to their free float -adjusted market capitalization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
The weight of the securities 
outside of the capped group will be increased in proportion to their weight prior 
to such capping.

 November . The MSCI 10/50 Indexes are in general rebalanced nine business 
days before the effective date. Similar to the MSCI 25/50 Indexes, another important objective of the current 
methodolog y is to minimiz e the tracking error between the MSCI 10/50 Index and 
the Parent Index, while keeping the index turnover to a reasonable level. This is 
achieved by rebalancing the MSCI 10/50 Index using an optimization process 
that aims to minimize the cons tituent weight differences between the MSCI 
10/50 Index and the Parent Index. However, unlike the MSCI 25/50 Indexes 
methodology, the index does not rebalance incase the 10/50 constrain ts are 
breached between the announcement date and the effective date. Appendix  I: Handling Infeasible Capping  
 
If the index does not have enough constituents required to rebalance the index, 
the buffers5, if applicable, would be reduced as required as a first step. If the 
index is still unable to rebalance using the reduce d buffers6, MSCI will 
temporarily maintain the Index for a minimum of two months before 
discontinuation, by adding the necessary number of securities to the index. The 
index discontinuation will follow the Index Termination Policy as per the MSCI 
Index Po licies7 and will coincide with a scheduled index review. The securities to 
be added to an index for temporary maintenance will be chosen based on the 
below criteria:  
# Securities deleted from the MSCI Capped Index that triggered the decrease in the 
number of entities, provided they remain eligible, e.g., exhibit required liquidity, were not 
deleted due to financial difficulties, etc. # Eligible securities of relevant size not included in the Parent Index, e.g., largest small cap 
size-segment securities if the  Parent Index is a MSCI Standard Index. In the event that no securities are eligible for temporary inclusion to the MSCI 
Capped Index, MSCI will be providing an index, as close as possible to the 
capping constraints. 5 A buffer of the value of each constraint is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short term 
market movements between two rebalancing s. 6 A minimum number of constituents in the Parent Index is requ ired at any point in time for an MSCI Capped 
Index to be rebalanced using buffer rules.
