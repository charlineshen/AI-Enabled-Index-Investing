The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1.

MSCI ESG Ratings aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance 
risks and opportunities. MSCI ESG Ratings use a weighted average key issue calculation that is 
normalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score ( 0-10), which is then translated to 
a seven -point scale from 'AAA' to 'CCC', indicating how an entity manages relevant key issues relative 
to industry peers. The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https://www.msci.com/esg -and-climate -

Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will

The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1.

The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage 
their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies with an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' are excluded from 
the Indexes. ESG Exclusions The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business In volvement Screening Research to identify companies that are 
involved in the following business activities. Companies that meet the business involvement criteria 
are excluded from the Indexes . 
* Conventional Weapons * Controversial Weapons * Nuclear Weapons * Civilian Firearms * Tobacco * Fossil Fuel Extraction * Thermal Coal Power * Arctic Oil & Gas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four level s of restrictiveness : Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive  and Least Restrictive . 
Each controversial activity screened by the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes ( except Fossil Fuel Extraction, 
Thermal Coal Power, Palm Oil, Arctic Oil & Gas and Global Norms ) is assigned to one of these 
restrictiveness  levels : 
 
""Most Restrictive"" screen applied * Controversial Weapons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
In addition to the above, companies are also excluded from the Indexes if they exhibit any of the 
following characteristics:  
* Companies assessed as having involv ement in ESG controversies that are classified as Red Flags 
(MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0). A Red Flag indicates an ongoing Very Severe ESG controversy 
implicating a company directly through its actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as ha ving involvement in Land Use and Biodiversity controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Land Use and Biodiversity 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Supply Chain Management 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to

Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will 
use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index."

1 Introduct ion 
The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1. 
  
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents (""Methodology Set""), including the present i ndex 
methodology document. The Methodology Set for the Indexes can be accessed from MSCI's webpage https://www.msci.com/index -
methodology in the section 'Search Methodology by Index Name or Index Code'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage 
their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies with an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' are excluded from 
the Indexes. ESG Exclusions The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business In volvement Screening Research to identify companies that are 
involved in the following business activities. Companies that meet the business involvement criteria 
are excluded from the Indexes . 
* Conventional Weapons * Controversial Weapons * Nuclear Weapons * Civilian Firearms * Tobacco * Fossil Fuel Extraction * Thermal Coal Power * Arctic Oil & Gas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.
MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four level s of restrictiveness : Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive  and Least Restrictive . 
Each controversial activity screened by the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes ( except Fossil Fuel Extraction, 
Thermal Coal Power, Palm Oil, Arctic Oil & Gas and Global Norms ) is assigned to one of these 
restrictiveness  levels : 
 
""Most Restrictive"" screen applied * Controversial Weapons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
In addition to the above, companies are also excluded from the Indexes if they exhibit any of the 
following characteristics:  
* Companies assessed as having involv ement in ESG controversies that are classified as Red Flags 
(MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0). A Red Flag indicates an ongoing Very Severe ESG controversy 
implicating a company directly through its actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as ha ving involvement in Land Use and Biodiversity controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Land Use and Biodiversity 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Supply Chain Management 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Missing MSCI ESG Controversies Score - Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on 
MSCI ESG Controversies . 
* Failure to comply with the United Nations Global Compact Principl es (UN Global Compact 
Alignment value of ""Fail"").

The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1.

The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage 
their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies with an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' are excluded from 
the Indexes. ESG Exclusions The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business In volvement Screening Research to identify companies that are 
involved in the following business activities. Companies that meet the business involvement criteria 
are excluded from the Indexes . 
* Conventional Weapons * Controversial Weapons * Nuclear Weapons * Civilian Firearms * Tobacco * Fossil Fuel Extraction * Thermal Coal Power * Arctic Oil & Gas

MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four level s of restrictiveness : Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive  and Least Restrictive . 
Each controversial activity screened by the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes ( except Fossil Fuel Extraction, 
Thermal Coal Power, Palm Oil, Arctic Oil & Gas and Global Norms ) is assigned to one of these 
restrictiveness  levels :

Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will

1 Introduct ion 
The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1. 
  
1 The Indexes are governed by a set of methodology and policy documents (""Methodology Set""), including the present i ndex 
methodology document. The Methodology Set for the Indexes can be accessed from MSCI's webpage https://www.msci.com/index -
methodology in the section 'Search Methodology by Index Name or Index Code'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
In addition to the above, companies are also excluded from the Indexes if they exhibit any of the 
following characteristics:  
* Companies assessed as having involv ement in ESG controversies that are classified as Red Flags 
(MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0). A Red Flag indicates an ongoing Very Severe ESG controversy 
implicating a company directly through its actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as ha ving involvement in Land Use and Biodiversity controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Land Use and Biodiversity 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Supply Chain Management 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Missing MSCI ESG Controversies Score - Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on 
MSCI ESG Controversies . 
* Failure to comply with the United Nations Global Compact Principl es (UN Global Compact 
Alignment value of ""Fail"").
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in 
controversial activities. According to this framework, there are four level s of restrictiveness : Most 
Restrictive, Highly Restrictive, Moderately Restrictive  and Least Restrictive . 
Each controversial activity screened by the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes ( except Fossil Fuel Extraction, 
Thermal Coal Power, Palm Oil, Arctic Oil & Gas and Global Norms ) is assigned to one of these 
restrictiveness  levels : 
 
""Most Restrictive"" screen applied * Controversial Weapons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
The Indexes use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage 
their ESG risks and opportunities. Companies with an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' are excluded from 
the Indexes. ESG Exclusions The Indexes use MSCI ESG Business In volvement Screening Research to identify companies that are 
involved in the following business activities. Companies that meet the business involvement criteria 
are excluded from the Indexes . 
* Conventional Weapons * Controversial Weapons * Nuclear Weapons * Civilian Firearms * Tobacco * Fossil Fuel Extraction * Thermal Coal Power * Arctic Oil & Gas

 3 Maintaining the MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes 3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews The Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will 
use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index.

The MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes (""the Indexes"") are free float -adjusted market capitalization -
weighted indexes that exclude companies from underlying MSCI indexes (""Parent Indexes"") based on 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The  following companies are excluded:  * Companies that are associated with conventional, controversial, civilian, and nuclear weapons as 
well as tobacco, palm oil and arctic oil & gas or * Companies that are assigned an MSCI ESG Rating of 'CCC' or * Companies that derive revenues from thermal coal power and extraction of select fossil fuels  or 
* Companies that are involved in Red Flag ESG controversies, Orange Flag Land Use and Biodiversity 
controversies or Orange Flag Supply Chain Management controversies  or 
* Compan ies that are not in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact principles In addition, the Indexes target a minimum 30% reduction in carbon emission intensity relative to the 
underlying parent indexes (""Parent Indexes"")1.

In addition to the above, companies are also excluded from the Indexes if they exhibit any of the 
following characteristics:  
* Companies assessed as having involv ement in ESG controversies that are classified as Red Flags 
(MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0). A Red Flag indicates an ongoing Very Severe ESG controversy 
implicating a company directly through its actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as ha ving involvement in Land Use and Biodiversity controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Land Use and Biodiversity 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are 
classified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Supply Chain Management 
Score of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company 
directly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to 
the company's actions, products, or operations . 
* Missing MSCI ESG Controversies Score - Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on

MSCI ESG Controversies provide assessments of controversies concerning the potential negative 
environmental, social, and/or governance impact of company operations, products and services. The 
evaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is designed to be consistent with international 
norms represented by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies Score falls on a 
0-10 scale, with ""0"" being the  most severe controversy.

 3 Maintaining the MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes 3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews The Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI 
Global Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business 
day of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG 
Controversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change 
Metrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For 
some securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month 
preceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of 
month, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies Index constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for 
compliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted 
if they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' 
companies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of 
June data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published 
by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review.  For such securities, MSCI will 
use ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index."
