MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  \n \n \n3 Maintaining the MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes  \n3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  \nThe Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI \nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business \nday of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG \nControversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change \nMetrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For \nsome securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month \npreceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of \nmonth, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies  \nIndex constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for \ncompliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted \nif they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' \ncompanies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of \nJune data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published \nby MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review. For such securities, MSCI will \nuse ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index. The pro forma Indexes are generally announced nine business days before the first business day of \nthe month. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance    \nThe following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Indexes between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted  below, securities will be added to the Index only if added to the \nParent Index. Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming \nineligible because of  a change in business involvement, MSCI ESG Rating and\/or failure to comply \nwith the UN Global Compact Principles and\/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies Score . 4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes.

The \nevaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is designed to be consistent with international \nnorms represented by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies Score falls on a \n0-10 scale, with \"0\" being the  most severe controversy.

MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  \n \n \nAppendix I: ESG Exclusions Criteria  \nMSCI ESG Research has developed a framework designed to define significant involvement in \ncontroversial activities.
