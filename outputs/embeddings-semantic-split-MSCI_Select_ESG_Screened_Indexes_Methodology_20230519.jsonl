An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company \ndirectly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially resolved or indirectly attributed to \nthe company's actions, products, or operations . * Companies assessed as having involvement in Supply Chain Management controversies that are \nclassified as Orange Flags (MSCI ESG Controversies: Environment - Supply Chain Management \nScore of 1). An Orange Flag indicates an ongoing Severe ESG controversy implicating a company \ndirectly, or a Very Severe ESG controversy that is either partially reso lved or indirectly attributed to \nthe company's actions, products, or operations . * Missing MSCI ESG Controversies Score - Companies not assessed by MSCI ESG Research on \nMSCI ESG Controversies . * Failure to comply with the United Nations Global Compact Principl es (UN Global Compact \nAlignment value of \"Fail\"). * Please refer to Appendix I for details on these criteria. 2.3 Weighting  Scheme  \nThe remaining securities, after the exclusions based on section 2.2, are weighted in proportion of their \nfree float -adjusted market capitalization. Additionally, security weights are adjusted to specific requirements of neutrality and active exposure \nrelative to sector\/country\/region categories as detailed in Appendix III. The applicable region \nneutrality and active exposure co nstraints, along with the GHG -Intensity reduction described in the \nnext section (2.4) , are applied through an iterative process until all restrictions are met simultaneously. 2.4 GHG Intensity Reduction    \nAfter the weighting scheme is applied as per section 2. 3, the GHG intensity relative to the Parent Index \nis assessed. If the GHG intensity3 is not at least 30% lower than the Parent Index , additional securities \nare excluded from the Eligible Universe to achieve a reduction of 30% GHG intensity relative to the \nParent Index. The following iterative process is applied : \n1. Securities are ranked in descending order of GHG intensity. 2. The security with the highest GHG intensity is excluded and the resulting Index is compared \nto the Parent Index, to deter mine if a 30% reduction in GHG intensity has been achieved. 3 Please refer to Appendix I V for details of the calculation of GHG Intensity.

MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  \n \n \n3 Maintaining the MSCI Select ESG Screened Indexes  \n3.1 Quarterly Index Reviews  \nThe Indexes are reviewed on a quarterly basis to coincide with the regular Index Reviews of the MSCI \nGlobal Investable Market Indexes. The changes are implemented as of the close of the last business \nday of February, May, August and November. In general, MSCI uses MSCI ESG Research data4 (including MSCI ESG Ratings, MSCI ESG \nControversies Scores , MSCI Business Involvement Screening Research  and MSCI Climate Change \nMetrics ) as of the end of the month preceding the Index Reviews for the rebalancing of the I ndex. For \nsome securities, such data may not be published by MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month \npreceding the Index Review. For such securities, MSCI will use ESG data published after the end of \nmonth, when available, for the rebalancing of the Inde x. The pro forma Indexes are in general announced nine business days before the effective date. 3.2 Monthly Review of Controversies  \nIndex constituents are reviewed on a monthly basis for the involvement in ESG controversies and for \ncompliance with the United  Nations Global Compact Principles. Existing constituents will be deleted \nif they face controversies as defined as defined by MSCI ESG Controversy Score of 0 ('Red flag' \ncompanies), or if they fail to comply with the UN Global Compact Principles. MSCI uses  MSCI ESG Controversies data as of the end of the month preceding the review (e.g., end of \nJune data for the end of July monthly review). For some securities, such data may not be published \nby MSCI ESG Research by the end of the month preceding the review. For such securities, MSCI will \nuse ESG data published after the end of month, when available, for the monthly review of the Index. The pro forma Indexes are generally announced nine business days before the first business day of \nthe month. 3.3 Ongoing Event -Related Maintenance    \nThe following section briefly describes the treatment of common corporate events within the Indexes. No new securities will be added (except where noted below) to the Indexes between Index Reviews. For cases where additions are noted  below, securities will be added to the Index only if added to the \nParent Index. Parent Index deletions will be reflected simultaneously. There are no deletions from the Indexes between Index Reviews on account of a security becoming \nineligible because of  a change in business involvement, MSCI ESG Rating and\/or failure to comply \nwith the UN Global Compact Principles and\/or decrease in MSCI ESG Controversies Score . 4 See section 4 for details of data sourced from MSCI ESG Research used in the Indexes.

MSCI SELECT ESG SCREENED INDEXES METHODOLOGY  | MAY 2023  \n \n \nEVENT TYPE      EVENT DETAILS    \n \nNew additions to the Parent Index  A new security added to the Parent Index (such as IPO \nand other early inclusions), will not be added to the \nIndex. Spin -Offs  All securities created as a result of the spin -off of an \nexisting Index constituent will not be added to the \nIndexes  at the time of event implementation. Reevaluation for addition in the Indexes will occur at \nthe subsequent Index Review. Merger\/Acquisition  If an existing Index constituent is acquired by a non -\nIndex constituent, the existing constituent will be \ndeleted from the Inde x and the acquiring non -\nconstituent will not be added to the Index. Changes in Security Characteristics  A security will continue to be an Index constituent if \nthere are changes in characteristics (country, sector, \nsize segment, etc.) Reevaluation for cont inued \ninclusion in the Index will occur at the subsequent \nIndex Review. Further detail and illustration regarding specific treatment of corporate events relevant to this Index \ncan be found in the MSCI Corporate Events Methodology book.

MSCI Indexes are \nadministered by MSCI Limited. 4.1 MSCI ESG Ratings  \nMSCI ESG Ratings aim to measure entities' management of environmental, social and governance \nrisks and opportunities. MSCI ESG Ratings use a weighted average key issue calculation that is \nnormalized by industry to arrive at an industry -adjusted ESG score ( 0-10), which is then translated to \na seven -point scale from 'AAA' to 'CCC', indicating how an entity manages relevant key issues relative \nto industry peers. The MSCI ESG Ratings methodology can be found at: https:\/\/www.msci.com\/esg -and-climate -\nmethodologies . 4.2 MSCI ESG Controversies  \nMSCI ESG Controversies provide assessments of controversies concerning the potential negative \nenvironmental, social, and\/or governance impact of company operations, products and services. The \nevaluation framework used in MSCI ESG Controversies is designed to be consistent with international \nnorms represented by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact. MSCI ESG Controversies Score falls on a \n0-10 scale, with \"0\" being the  most severe controversy. The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology can be found at: https:\/\/www.msci.com\/esg -and-climate -\nmethodologies . 4.3 MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research  \nMSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research (BISR) aims to enable institutional investors to \nmanage environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and restrictions reliably and \nefficiently. For more details on MSCI ESG Business Involvement Screening Research, please refer to \nhttp:\/\/www.msci.com\/resources\/factsheets\/MSCI_ESG_BISR.pdf . 4.4 MSCI Climate Change Metrics  \nMSCI Climate Change Metrics provides climate data & tools to suppor t institutional investors seeking \nto integrate climate risk & opportunities into their investment strategy and processes. This includes \ninvestors seeking to achieve a range of objectives, including measuring and reporting on climate risk \nexposure, implemen ting low carbon and fossil fuel -free strategies, alignment with temperature \npathways and factoring climate change research into their risk management processes, in particular \nthrough climate scenario analysis for both transition and physical risks.
